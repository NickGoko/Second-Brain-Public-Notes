# Nick's Digital Mind Garden ü™¥

I'm **Nick Goko** and you happen to find yourself inside my brain or rather my mind garden. Filled with all kinds of information about everything i would tattoo into my brain. But since i can't do that. I created this :)

## Why am i doing this?
So why would i want to let people into my brain. Like a reverse mind reading power. Because most if not all the information here was free. Countless nameless heroes decided to share their knowledge and expertise and i was lucky enough to find it. So i am paying it forward. Also i am so doing it for me. 
Also i am embracing the idea of learning in public. I love seeing the notes online and publicly accessible. 

> Huge shout out to [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://www.youtube.com/@nicolevdh) who's youtube video on publishing Obsidian Notes with Quartz helped immensely.
