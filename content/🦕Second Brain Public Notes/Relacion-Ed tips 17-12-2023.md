# SexEd
## Dirty Talk
### **Lesson One:**
The biggest myth about getting started with dirty talk is the idea that you need to jump right into creating an elaborate roleplay where you're a police officer or a cheerleader or that you need to pretend to be someone that you're not. Or that you need to memorize any kind of script.

In fact - you can get started right now by acknowledging that dirty talk can be as simple as 'don't stop', 'just like that', 'you feel so good', 'you're so hot/sexy', or if even that seems too intimidating it could be just whispering 'fuck'.

The truth is that using just a few words can be just as hot or hotter than having a 200 word speech memorized.

### **Lesson Two:**

**Understand that everyone likes to hear different 'ideas' in bed - although there are a few safe areas you could start.**

everyone is different and what is a turn-on for one person may be a turn-off for another - that's why discussing these things outside of bed can be a good idea - if its too awkward then talk about it over text.

These first few are safer and probably more common.

**Encouragement:**

'Fuck me', 'you can cum for me', 'I want you to cum', 'I want you to fuck me', 'I want to make you cum', 'just like that!', 'nice and slow, just like that', 'harder! just like that!', 'that feels so good', 'oh yes', 'don't stop'

**Sweet:**

'you are amazing', 'I need you', 'you mean so much to me', 'I love you'

**Questioning:**

"Do you want to fuck me?", "Do you want my cock?", "Does that feel good?", "Do you like that?"

**Describing how they feel:**

"That feels so good doesn't it?", "you want to fuck me so bad", "you're going to cum right away, aren't you?",

**Compliments:**

"You're so big", "it's so deep", "you're so tight", "you're so hard for me", "you're so wet"

Then you have some that are more niche and specific to the desires of the individual - you may want to ask the person about them outside of the bedroom (or via text if it's less intimidating to bring up)

**Impregnation:**

'Cum in me', 'Fill me up', 'I'm gonna cum in you', 'get me pregnant', 'make a baby in me', 'let it go'

**Ownership:**

'I own you', 'you belong to me', 'this is my pussy', 'this is my cock', 'your _____ belongs to me'

**Praise:**

'Good _____ (girl, boy, pet, etc)' or 'bad _____ ' :O, 'be a good _____ for me', 'be a good _____ and _____ for me', 'that's a good boy/girl/pet', 'that's my good _____ ', etc.

**Body parts** (if you know your partner loves a certain part of you - might be good to ask them ahead of time if there's a certain part of you that drives them wild if you don't want this to backfire):

"Look at my ass", "you can't keep your eyes off this cock", "You like looking at my _____ (tits, ass, cock, chest, legs, pussy, etc)?", "do you like my _____ ?", "you want to touch my _____so bad don't you?",

**Teasing** (delivery is more important here):

"You want me, don't you?", ""You're not gonna last, are you?", "is this gonna make you cum?", "you like that, don't you?"

**Denial** (which goes along with teasing - it's about temporarily denying something so they have to wait):

So if you said "You want me to _____ (fuck you/touch your _____ /let you cum/take off my _____ ), don't you?", then you could follow up with: 'that's too bad', 'not yet', 'you have to wait', 'you need to earn my _____ (pussy/cock)', 'if you're a good _____ (boy/girl/) / good for me, I'll let you'.

This is slightly more advanced obviously but tease and denial go hand in hand - you make them earn something, wait for something, or beg for something.

Which leads to...

**Begging:**

'Please fuck me', 'Please let me cum', Please let me see your _____ ', 'I want your _____ so bad', etc.

Just gonna say - this one is pretty much a nuclear stimulant for many people. Just add 'please' to the beginning or end of anything else and whimper out the word while looking them in the eyes. 'Please cum in me' with a pleading look over and over is a personal fav although it may make things end prematurely. Works for any gender, don't let expectations about sexuality or gender hold you back: girl riding on top of you? Repeatedly mutter 'please don't stop' or 'please let me cum' in a breathy voice and watch what happens.

This works well with tease or denial as well. You could tease your partner 'do you want to fuck me/me to fuck you?', then if they say yes, say 'beg for it'. Of course they might just stare at you in confusion, in which case you could instruct them, "Say 'please fuck me'/'please let me fuck you'", insist and say 'I'm waiting', and then follow up with 'good _____ (boy/girl/pet)' when they comply. Now you can start to see how some of these concepts can even link together quite well.


**Titles:**

Some people like to be called certain names in bed, and you may find that even though saying these names doesn't turn you on or get you off that it's hot enough seeing your partner's eye's light up or seeing their reaction that you enjoy saying these words or calling them by these names. They are incredibly individual and what may make one person aroused might make another laugh, but that's OK. Examples might be 'sir, good boy, good girl, bad boy, bad girl, daddy, slut, princess, whore, doll, toy, master, slave, mistress' - as you can see this can easily get into some BDSM-ish areas but that's OK - if using a word like this gets you excited just go for it and forget about whether it's weird or has connotations you don't want to associate with.

Titles are great for adding variety to other existing dirty talk. Instead of 'fuck me' it's 'fuck me daddy' or 'fuck me slut'. Instead of 'please let me cum' it's 'please let me cum, sir' or 'please let me cum, mistress'

**Degradation** (degrading acts is often described as acts that made the person feel less than or demeaned, degrading words are often described as words that feel demeaning or make one feel small or disrespected:

'you're my slut', 'I'm your whore', 'you're a fuck toy/doll', 'you're my bitch'

**Humiliation** (obviously this is only for certain types of masochists - but it's more common than you think - just ask your partner what they're into! this one is extremely individual and different people prefer to be humiliated for different things, in different ways, for different traits, or with specific words. be careful):

'You're worthless', 'you're not enough for me', 'you're just a whore/slut', 'is that all you've got?', 'this is all you're good for', some people like words like 'slut/whore/fucktoy' some like getting their dick size made fun of ('you're so small, I can barely feel you, etc') it's all very individual. There's a tremendous amount of variety in this kink and you have to find out what in particular your partner enjoys and research it.

**Orders** (for some people this may seem very safe but you'd be surprised by how many people simply are not OK with this - and that's perfectly valid so if you want to be safe you can discuss this first):

'Suck my _____ ', 'Get on your knees', 'Kneel for me', 'Ass in the air', 'Spread your legs', 'Show me your _____ ', 'Get your _____ out', 'Stroke your cock', 'Look at my _____ and _____ (touch yourself/stroke your cock)', 'Look at me', 'Look me in the eyes', 'Take off your _____ ', 'Stand up and undress yourself for me', 'Undress yourself and kneel', 'Undress yourself and get on your hands and knees', 'Get that cock out', 'Fuck me harder!', 'Faster Harder!'

 **Deserving something**:

"Do you think you deserve my cock/pussy?", 'do you think you deserve to see my body?', 'do you deserve to cum?', 'I don't think you deserve to fuck me', 'I don't think you deserve this cock', I don't think you deserve to cum yet'

This might lead to -

**Earning something**:

'If you want to _____ (cum/fuck me) you're going to have to _____ me/for me', 'if you want me to touch you then you need to beg', 'if you want to fuck me then you better make me cum', 'if you want me to fuck you then you better get on your knees', if you want to cum then you better beg for it'

**Punishment**

'You've been a bad ___ (girl/boy)', 'time to get spanked', 'you've been bad, maybe I shouldn't suck your cock', 'you've been bad, maybe I shouldn't rub your clit', 'you've been a naughty boy/girl, I don't think you deserve pleasure yet'

**Trigger warning: non-consent, jealousy, cheating**:

Extremely risky (but often appreciated by some)

**Teasing++ / stoking competitiveness** - this can be a mix of teasing, humiliation, jealousy-play. For some who aren't into hotwife/cuckold they may still like the competitive nature of this. For others it crosses over into worst nightmare, so be careful!:

'Can you fuck me harder?', 'are you going to cum already?', 'can you keep going or will it make you cum?', 'is this the best you can do?', 'fuck me like you mean it'

### **Lesson Three:**
Ask your partner which ideas or themes appeal to them.

This is pretty obvious, but you can have an open dialogue about these topics, about these ideas, find out what did it for them, what they may like to try. If you have a new partner or haven't broached it with them, you may start off by sticking to the safe topics and then ask them about others later.

### **Lesson Four:**

Start with basics, and then add synonyms, variations, change wording, and eventually improvise with your scaffolding.

This is a huge one. If you learn that your partner really likes hearing about a particular theme, you may want to eventually start building a vocab around that topic. You have to be very careful and move slowly with many of these themes though.

If 'you're a slut' turns them on, see about saying 'you're my slut', 'you're such a fucking slut', 'whose slut are you?', 'you're my slut', 'are you gonna be a good slut for me?'.

If slut works, then see about similar words like whore. You could replace every 'slut' in the previous section with 'whore', or try 'fucktoy'. Part of this is about creating a sense of never knowing what's coming next and maintaining unpredictability.

It's important to note that people have different triggers, associations, and feelings about words that may seem very similar to you, so you may want to ask them ahead of time about each word, if they say that a word doesn't work for them - just take their word for it even if it doesn't make sense to you.

If they enjoy 'cum for me', you could start adding in 'do you want to cum for me?', 'are you going to cum for me?', 'I bet you want to cum for me'.

You can cross into new areas or find new kinks by linking existing ones. So if you know they like 'cum for me', you can help them build a new kink or discover they have a different kink by crossing from 'cum for me' to 'be a good boy/girl/pet and cum for me' and they may end up eventually creating a new arousal trigger for those new words as well. Maybe you start saying 'I wonder if I can make you cum for me in 30 seconds'.

If someone likes hearing how great their cock is, you want to try to build new phrases that mean the same thing in over time. You start off with 'you're so big', but slowly add 'your cock is so thick', 'your cock is so deep', 'it's stretching me', 'you're stretching me', 'you're so fucking big', 'I can barely take you', etc.

Finally, if you have a scaffolding in place and some of this stuff starts to feel stale or like you could do it in your sleep, then you might start building stories, roleplays, etc. around them.

If 'cum for me' is too easy, start going for 'You're going to get undressed when we get home, you're going to get your favorite toy out, I'm going to use it on you and you're going to cum for me'.

### **Lesson Five:**

You may not truly believe that two words alone or three words alone can be all you need to unleash a flood of arousal within your partner.

Going further, you may not believe it, but sometimes repeating the simplest thing over and over is the hottest thing ever. You might imagine saying 'I own you' or 'cum in me' or 'you don't deserve me' or 'that's right, suck my cock' over and over again sounds like it would just get stale or boring or weird. You might think you need to not repeat yourself. But if you find something that triggers arousal in your partner, repeating it over and over again to them during sex might actually be the hottest thing ever to them.

### **Lesson Six:**

If you have confidence in dirty talk but your partner does not, feels self-conscious about it, or feels flustered if you use dirty talk that requires a response from them or asks them a question, then you may want to stick to statements not questions. Instead of 'do you like it when I _____ ?' you might start with something that doesn't need a response like 'you feel so good'.

### **Lesson Seven:**

Are you nervous to start? Don't know what to begin with? This is just me, but I think the easiest thing to do is to try something that's only 2 or 3 words, and say it during any sex act where you are both being pleasured at the same time - intercourse or 69 would be my personal recommendation. You might stumble over your words, forget what you wanted to say, or feel embarrassed about your delivery if you say something that's multi-part or complex, but a simple 'don't stop' or 'you're so tight/wet/hard/big' is short enough that you will feel less pressure and basic enough that very few people would throw you out of bed, think you're trying too hard, or think it's weird.


## Oral Sex
I focus my mouth on the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">clitoris, the hooded protrusion of skin immediately above the vaginal opening. </mark>  
What I do with my <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">tongue is apply broad pressure with the middle and work my way up and down, slowly pushing that hood back and eventually applying direct pressure onto the clit as her excitement grows. </mark>  
While doing this, I usually have my <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">left hand directly above her vagina on her stomach and I push gently downward and toward my face.</mark>  
My right hand (or your dominant hand if your a lefty, reverse this) will have the two middle fingers inside of her.

Do this with your hand: take your index and pinky fingers and curl them in toward your palm, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">insert your middle and ring fingers and curl them upward towards your other hand that is on her stomach</mark>.  
 <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Feel around for a slightly tougher spot of skin, or more ribbed sort of feeling area.</mark> This is her<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;"> g-spot</mark>.  
 The pinky and index fingers can now be relaxed, and pointed slightly toward one another at the tips. This will give more surface area to be stimulated by the motion of your other two fingers inside of her as well as allow your tongue more area to explore and stimulate.

Now begin rocking your two middle fingers back in forth in rhythm with your tongue on her clit.  
Your two outside fingers will also be giving gentle pressure to the sides of her labia, and ultimately, putting small pressure on the sides of her clitoris.

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Doing this for about three-four minutes would bring most of the girls I have been with to a pretty powerful initial orgasm.</mark>  
Relax some, and gently caress, feel them out... then do it again. Rinse (hehe) and repeat until she (or your forearm) can no longer take it. Their orgasms from this seem to get more and more powerful the longer you go.  
Often times, with enough upward pressure on the g-spot, this will also result in squirting. This technique has served me very, very well.  
I plan on continuing to use it, as it seems to apply direct forward and side pressure to the clit, labial stimulation by the fingers, and g-spot pressure from inside against the hand on her stomach to hopefully stimulate more of those nerves.  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">That outside hand can also be used to pull a leg over your shoulder, reach up to pull on hair, caress the neck, or cup some of that sweet ass upward against your face when she begins writhing about.</mark>

### Eating out
stimulating her inner thighs by licking or kissing them, sucking on her outer and inner lips and stimulating every bit of her vulva.  
Listen to the girl and how much pressure she likes (and where).  
Some of us enjoy some light nibbling or some chin action to get more force on the vulva (especially vaginal opening, perineum or even the clit).  
You may feel silly doing it at first, but humming or moaning while your mouth is on her can act like a vibrator and intensify the sensation. Don’t be afraid to get into it; our vaginas aren’t super delicate flowers made out of paper. Most of us can take a fair bit of action (think of what happens during vigorous sex). Yes, lots of girls may prefer a gentle, slow licking motion, but others may barely even feel that.

So what exactly do you do with your tongue? Just move it around! Try swirling it in circles, moving up and down or just side to side. A common idea to keep her guessing is to try to write the alphabet on the clit, or being as random with your motions as you can. You can also try sealing your lips around her clit and actually sucking it while moving your tongue around. As a girl nears orgasm, many find that constant pressure and consistent motions at this point helps bring them to orgasm. Most women need direct clitoral stimulation to climax. Some, however, have very sensitive clits that can’t handle being touched. In these cases, just stimulate the nub over the clitoral hood.

Don’t forget to keep using your hands while you go down on her. You can rub the lower part of her vulva or insert a finger or two into her vagina and [stimulate her g-spot](#) while you’re licking her clit. You can even reverse roles and use your tongue on her vagina and rub her clit with your fingers. Don’t forget about her inner and outer lips, her pubic mound or her thighs too. It can be a nice break to go off and play with those other parts before returning to the clit and vagina. And you can always stimulate a breast or two with your free hand (or any other erogenous zone on her body within reaching distance).

### How to Please a Woman
**Always mind her clit.** In the missionary position, you can grind against her clit with your pubic bone while you’re deep inside of her. You can reach it with your hand or fingers from virtually any position. Don’t be shy about bringing a vibrator to bed with you – we promise she won’t think less of you for letting her ride a [Hitachi Magic Wand](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327025918/http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Held-Personal-Massager-Attachment/dp/B001BZYGWQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1309549392&sr=8-2) or [vibrating bulle](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327025918/http://www.amazon.com/Tantrica-Waterproof-Silver-Bullet-Vibrator/dp/B000MUTD7Y/ref=tag_dpp_lp_edpp_ttl_in)t while you are fucking her from behind. Clitoral stimulation is the key to most women’s orgasms, so approach her clit with gusto!

**Stretch her perineum.** The entire posterior (butt side) wall of the vagina is very elastic and rich in nerve endings. It has to be, to allow a baby to pass through it. By stretching this wall, you’ll give your lady a sense of fullness, no matter how big your penis is. By massaging the perineum with two, then three, then four fingers, you will also, with patience and lube, be able to [insert your entire fist](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327025918/http://www.amazon.com/Fisting-Responsibility-Trust-Kim-Powers/dp/379860181X/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1309549614&sr=8-6). Be sure to go slow and wait for her to relax the muscles, or you could cause a tear.

**Get to know her **G-spot******.** Do you know [where her G-spot is](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327025918/http://www.sexpertslounge.com/2011/06/28/how-to-help-a-partner-squirt/ "How To Help a Partner Squirt"), and how a G-spot works? It’s located one to three inches inside her vagina, directly behind her urethra. Another name for the G-spot is the urethral sponge.  When stimulated, it fills with fluid, growing to the size of a [large walnut](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327025918/http://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Nuts-Walnuts--Shell-16-Ounce/dp/B000XKIX60/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1309549935&sr=8-1). With enthusiastic g-spot stimulation, most women can ejaculate this fluid, but it can take a little while for women to figure out how their own G-spot works. Your hand is a better tool for the job than your penis, so we recommend experimenting manually. Once you know what it takes to make her cum this way, try some positions that focus your penis on this spot. Before you know it, she’ll be having “vaginal” orgasms.

**Be careful of her cervix.** The cervix is a cone that covers her uterus and points towards the vaginal opening.  The tip of the cone has a “mouth” that is sensitive to pain and doesn’t appreciate being bashed with a penis, unless your girl is into that. The sides of the cervix are much less sensitive, so position your penis above or below the cervix and thrust into her vaginal walls instead – brushing the edges is OK.  

**Find the other deep spots.** There are two points where the cervix meets the vaginal wall at the very back of the vagina called the anterior and posterior fornices.  The anterior fornix is a key pleasure point for women. It is located 5 or 6 inches into the vagina on the clit-side wall, directly behind the clit. Some men may not be able to reach these spots using their penis, but nearly everyone can by using their fingers. Press all the way back along the top wall of her vagina. Apply firm pressure directed towards the clit and rock your hand forward and back in this place, and she will rapidly lubricate and probably have a “clitoral” orgasm.

**Pay attention to her cues.** Body language cues can tell you a lot about what your lady is feeling. The hair flick and come-hither look got you into bed, so don’t stop paying attention once you’re there! Flushing of the face, neck and chest, increased heart rate or breathing speed, panting, thrusting of the hips, and clenching or pushing of the muscles both outside and inside the vagina can all be clear signs that you’re doing something right. “Just like that!” means exactly that—keep up what you’re doing, exactly as you’re doing it, and until she moans, “Harder, faster!” keep the jackhammer in check.

### Other Tips
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Circles</mark>. This move is very useful for a particular reason : <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">I noticed that going straight to the clit can be kinda painfull at first for the girl, it's too sensitive sometimes and you need to warm it up.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">so you'll need the circle move, that allows you to stimulate around the clitoris.</mark>  
Imagine that it's like when a girl gently slide her hand up and down your cock before blowing you, it does not feel particularly awesome, but it gets you hard and waiting for the real deal.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Suck</mark>. Yes, suck. The sucking adds variety to what is happening to her clit, I guess it drives blood into it, and such things... but this move is important because it allows you to rest your tongue, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">it gives you this 1 or 2 seconds break you need, plus she'll want you to start licking again, while still feeling stuff.</mark>

Don't go straight to the mofuckin' clit. Never.  
It's too sudden, too fast, it takes all the fun out of getting a blowjob. Well, for girls, it's even more important to really build things up, because <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">it's not really about how much they are stimulated, it's about how much they are aroused</mark>.  
So what you need to do, is take your time to get where she knows you're going. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Caress her legs, her ass, her pussy without opening it up and sticking a finger in it, kiss her tits, her belly etc... while you slowly go down there.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">At this point, she should be getting hot, she's expecting your tongue in her pussy at any moment but doesn't really know when, and it drives her mad in a good way.</mark>

Then you finally stick your tongue in.  
Make sure the lips are spread apart, so you've got enough room to operate. Again, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">you need to warm her up, and the best way to do that is to make sure she experiences a wide range of pleasurable feelings, and a little frustration too.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">So you gently but firmly explore her pussy with your tongue, the inner lips are not very sensitive, nor is the entry to the vagina, but still make her feel your tongue there and there, mess around</mark>.  
 Then, focus more (but not only) on the more interesting parts : <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">circle the clit and go up and down in this kinda flat area between the clit and the vag.</mark>  
 You can start to lick the clit too, but don't rush things up, be gentle and soft.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">So this was the two parts of the warm up.</mark>  
She should start to enjoy herself, moan a little etc... The thing is, you really don't know if she's already warmed up enough, and want you to really get started, or if she wants you to keep this pace for a little more time.  
Well, my friend, you have to guess this by how she reacts. Let's say she's ready for you to really give her pleasure.  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Now you can lick the clit up and down, but not too fast !</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Lick the whole area </mark><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">between her vag and the top of her clit</mark>, so each stroke <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">starts and end on a part not too sensitive but always stimulate her clit. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Accelerate your pace</mark>, but keep <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">doing other stuff</mark>.  
Try things. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Stimulates the upper part of the clit, which is under some kind of "hood" with a left and right movement, suck on that clit, stick your tongue in her vag...</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Keep accelerating your pace slowly as her pleasure builds up, apply more pressure etc...</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">At some point you'll realize it's probably a matter of really short minutes, even maybe seconds before she comes</mark>,  
 <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">so then and only then start to really go nuts on the clit</mark>,  
  <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">do wide, strong movements and short rapid licks, suck on it strongly when your tongue starts to hurt...</mark>  
  <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">when she starts to cum, and you'll notice, just focus on that clit for a final rush, but at the end, when she's at the very climax, just suck on it strongly, and then release it.</mark>  
  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It's probably getting too sensitive for direct stimulation, so sucking on it is the best option for the grande finale.</mark>

Now there is a few things that are absolutely essential that I have to add.  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">First, get to learn every girl you go down on. Some things that work with a girl, might not work with another, see how she reacts to what you do and adapt.</mark>  
TALK TO HER. There's nothing shameful about asking what was good and what was bad, communication is the key to all relationships.  
Secondly, but it should have been first, be sensual. Listen to the girl's body, try to feel it, take pleasure from what you're doing, make her feel that you're into her, even if going down on a girl is not particularly something you like. In one word : be fuckin passionate about it ! This means use your damn hands. Keep caressing her, more and more firmly as it gets more intense, grab her, push her towards you, look her in the eyes. It should not be just a tongue on her clit,

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">let her rest a little while cuddling her when it's over even if you're going to bang right after that</mark>

when I'm talking about the final rush, or going nuts on the clit don't take this too seriously. If you follow my advice, you've been pretty gentle from the beginning, so going faster and stronger shouldn't mean going really crazy, the line between "hm, harder, this feels so good" and "huh, it hurts" is easy to cross.

Secondly : some people here wrote that they had some even better results when the slowed down at the very end. I think it's really interesting, and I'm going to try it ASAP, and you should too.

EDIT 2 : As some girls said, depending on whether or not the girl you're giving oral to likes penetration a lot, fingering her can be a great idea, or not so much. Again, get to know the girl so you know what she really likes. Here is, according to carolinared, how you should proceed :

> two fingers going slightly in and straight up in a come hither motion while the clit is getting some work done is fucking amazing.

### How To Give A Woman Oral Sex: Master The Art Of Oral
**Get creative with your tongue.**  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The flat surface on top of your tongue is soft and flexible, whilst the tip is harder</mark> and can exert more pressure.  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Try using the full, top part of your tongue at first, maybe moving to the tip later – if she likes that.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Keep your tongue flat and soft, and lick up from the bottom of the labia to the clitoris at the beginning. If she enjoys that, you can eventually move on.</mark>

Move your tongue in an up and down motion, or side to side. Whatever you choose to do, spend some time on each movement in a constant rhythm. Start slow, build steadily, and allow some time to see how she reacts to each movement and repeated rhythm.

**Vary your movements**  
It pays to be observant, so keep track of which movements elicit moans of pleasure, and stick with the ones that do, at least for a while.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">A classic trick to discover new movements is to spell out the alphabet with your tongue around the entire area.</mark> This means large, flowing, and artful calligraphy – not tiny letters with a fine-tipped pen!

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">When you find a letter, or part of a letter, that makes her moan, experiment with that letter a bit more.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Alternatively, finish the alphabet and then go back to the letter movements that she seemed to like most.</mark>

You need to keep that rhythm going, but start to gradually speed up and press harder as she moans louder. Remember, gradually means over the course of several minutes, not seconds.

Don’t neglect the rest of her genitals either – it’s not all about the clitoris. Many women have a sensitive patch just to one side of the clitoris, for example. Lick there and see what reaction you get.

**Get comfortable**

If you’re planning on spending a decent amount of time giving her oral sex, there are two issues that can crop up, both around your comfort.

The first is **neck ache**, which can be handled by switching positions. Having her sit on a couch or the side of the bed with you between her legs can work.  
Alternatively, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">try putting a pillow under her bum to raise the area slightly.</mark>

Secondly, there’s **tongue ache**. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">If your tongue starts to get tired, gently suck her clitoris or kiss around the vaginal area instead.</mark>  
After a couple of seconds, you can go back to licking.

Unless your neck is hurting or you have a preexisting condition, it’s worth putting up with a bit of discomfort. She probably does the same for you!

**Use your hands**

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If you’re in the right position, you can simultaneously caress her body with your hands while your tongue is busy.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The breasts, inner thighs, and backs of the knees are all erogenous zones, so stroking them will make her feel great.</mark>

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">You can also use her hands to spread her labia, giving you better access.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Try pushing up the hood of the clitoris to reach the more sensitive part with your tongue (this is a technique for later, not right at the beginning).</mark>

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Alternatively, you can penetrate her with your fingers. If you’re going down the penetration route, there are a couple of options. Try inserting one or two fingers and making a ‘come here’ motion to stimulate her G-spot.  
</mark>  
You could also let your fingers linger and stroke around her entrance to take advantage of the massive amount of nerves there. Both are good, and a combination is even better.

Don’t insert any fingers until she’s lubricated and turned on though.

**Experiment with different positions**  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">There are many positions that work for oral sex. From lying down to sitting up, 69, or even sideways (resting your head on her inner thigh helps deal with neck ache).</mark>

Try different positions to find out which ones work best for you and your partner. And try not to get stuck in a pattern of repeating the same step-by-step routine every time you have sex or some of the anticipation and excitement will slowly wane.

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Having said that, try not to switch positions if you’re already going down on her and she’s enjoying it. If you do, you might break the flow and make it more difficult for her to reach orgasm.</mark>


**Don’t stress if she doesn’t climax**

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">On a final note, don’t be upset if she doesn’t climax when you give her oral sex.</mark> It’s important not to get stuck in a vicious cycle of questioning why she doesn’t come.

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Keep working on it, but don’t create any drama around the issue. Not all women will orgasm with oral, but it doesn’t mean it’s not an amazing experience that they enjoy before, during, or after penetrative sex.  
</mark>

**For men with premature ejaculation**

When I first started having sex, the idea of pulling out during sex and giving my partner oral for a while was always a bit strange to me, so I didn’t do it much.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">With time and experience, however, I’ve come to learn that this is actually a good way to deal with premature ejaculation and extend your lovemaking session.</mark>

Ideally, you don’t want to pull out just as you’re on the verge of orgasm, give her oral for a minute or two and then go back to it because you might find you’re still too close to ejaculating. Learn to stop before you’re at the point of no return, and then switch to oral sex for a bit.

Again, some experimenting is probably needed to make it work for you and your partner. But I do recommend trying this if you struggle with how long you typically last during sex.

## Foreplay
Heres something you can work on regardless of your insecurities, if you have fingers and a tongue. Remember to TAKE YOUR TIME.  
Dont rush through them!

1. Be dominant and give yourself time to tease her properly. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Consider foreplay as a fun kind of torture to understand it better and tease her before she gets to see or touch you.</mark>
    
2. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Run your fingers around her neck and arms while you kiss her.</mark>
    
3. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Run you hands lower around her breasts WITHOUT touching them, while you kiss her neck.</mark>
    
4. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Occasionally brush over her nipples, but when she isn't expecting it. Basically tease the shit out of her. And when you think she NEEDS it, touch them briefly</mark>, but <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">maintain that power!</mark>
    
5. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Keep this power game of teasing up so that she almost has to beg for you to touch her.</mark>
    
6. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Move on to the next hot points between her thighs with the same teasing technique.</mark>  
   <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Run your fingers up and down her legs, avoiding her pussy completely, but acting like every time that you MIGHT touch it.</mark>
    
7. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Move your fingers inside of her pants or panties if she still has them on, and tease that crease between her thighs and her vulva.</mark>
    
8. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Repeat steps 1-7 all over again...remember you still haven't touched her pussy yet.</mark>  
   I promise she will be soaking wet (!EDIT! or generally aroused) by the time you get to it.

9. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">When you finally get to her pussy</mark>, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">with your fingers, take the same torture technique to her labia inside and out, while avoiding her clitoris and putting anything inside yet.</mark>
    
10. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Rub around it, next to it etc, and watch as she squirms trying to get you to touch it.</mark>
    
11. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Run through steps 1-10 again</mark>. I think you see what's going on here! TEASE!
    
12. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Eventually when you do touch her clitoris with your fingers, check her responses to how she likes to be touched - we all enjoy different things. </mark>  
    Experience is your friend here and if you follow the steps above, you will be getting lots of it I promise!
    
13. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">At this point you can also enter 1 finger inside her slowly, but remember to keep building up to every extra step you do! Push and pull.</mark>
    
14. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Do the same steps 7-13 with your mouth.</mark>
    
15. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Use your fingers inside her while you suck her clit.</mark> In porn I've seen that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">men often lick, but from discussions with my girlfriends & my preferences, most women prefer having their clitoris sucked like it was a mini-penis.</mark>
    
16. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">At this point she'll most likely be demanding your penis, and you can ease into it confidently, knowing you made her feel amazing.</mark>

### The Art of the Tease
My instinctual idea was to play with my partner’s arousal level, repeatedly building her to a crescendo, but never quite reaching the high notes.

So I spent time just gently running my fingertips over her whole body. Then gently kissing her all over. Making her moan as I spent an impossibly long time teasing her with my tongue – getting agonizingly close to her nipples and between the legs, before going back to other parts of the body.

I whispering naughty things in her ear and occasionally spanked her – even more erotic since she couldn’t see it coming. I made her reach out to kiss my mouth, letting her know my mouth was close enough to kiss, but not permitting a kiss until I wanted her to.

Eventually, I headed south to [lavish her with oral sex](https://www.risingmaster.com/how-to-give-a-woman-oral-sex/), and once again kept breaking off to return to other parts of the body.

Over many minutes I slowly made it more intense, to the point that I could feel she might orgasm if I only kept going for a minute…but I didn’t.

I don’t recall how many times I brought her close to orgasm with my tongue that first time, but it was probably an unnecessarily large amount as I was enjoying it so much.

She was literally writhing on the bed with the sexual tension by the time I finally positioned myself on top to join the party.

And to my great surprise and delight, she came almost immediately.



## Be Great at Sex
Sexual proficiency is a complex and diverse topic. If I had to pick just one helpful skill, I would have to say **communication**. People who are comfortable with their sexuality and able to discuss sexual topics openly, honestly, and without judgement can get through almost any situation.

People who are **comfortable about sex** are more sexually assertive – they can ask for what they want, and let their partners know what is and isn’t working. Sexually active people should expect to encounter a variety of difficult issues in their sex lives. Almost everyone experiences or encounters issues around sexual dysfunction, jealousy, or identity at some point. Strong communication skills are essential when trying to overcome these problems.

Another important key to a fulfilling sex life is **selflessness**. Let your partner know just how much you love exploring their body and giving them pleasure. Every inch of a person’s body can be an erogenous zone – not just the “naughty bits”. Take your time and celebrate your partner’s whole body using your hands, your mouth or even toys.

Taking your time is especially important when it comes to foreplay. Make sure your partner knows that you enjoy focusing solely on them – **enthusiasm** is key. Smile, make eye contact, moan, and tell them how great they taste/feel/look. This is especially important with oral sex. Many people get antsy while receiving oral because it can take a significant amount of time and it can be uncomfortable or feel selfish to have all the attention focused on you.

Make it clear that you **enjoy giving oral** as much as they enjoy receiving it. Your partner should know that you’re going to provide oral for only as long as you want to, and that your only goal is to make them feel good. Make sure that your partner knows that you like going down, even if it doesn’t lead to orgasm. If you can  focus on the journey instead of the end, all the sex you have will be more fulfilling.

Talk to your partner about wanting sex to be **sensation-focused**, not orgasm-focused. It can take the pressure off and help both of you to relax, which will allow you to fully enjoy the sensations you’re experiencing. If someone feels dysfunctional or inadequate it frequently leads to a rapid downward spiral. By making sex about the journey, you avoid this situation and actually increase a person’s chance of achieving climax.

Another important attitude to have is **open-mindedness**. You may not be into every sexual act, kink and fetish out there, but it’s very important to be accepting of people who enjoy acts that you don’t. You need your partner to feel safe, so don’t judge or make fun of them for their fantasies or sexual desires. If something they like makes you uncomfortable, do your best to get comfortable with it. This attitude helps you build intimacy in your relationships.

You won’t always succeed at embracing a partner’s sexual interests, so it is important to be able to find a way to **compromise** so that you both feel satisfied and neither of you feel pressured to do anything you don’t want. For example, if a man wants to receive anal play during sex but their partner isn’t into it, maybe their partner could use a toy, or if that’s still an issue, maybe the man could use the toy on himself while his partner stimulates other parts of his body. You’ll eventually be on both ends of the conversation, so never try to make a partner feel bad for wanting to try something new or something they enjoy.

**Technique** is important, but it’s a little bit useless if your partner doesn’t feel safe and intimate with you, so I wanted to cover the other topics first. The worst thing you can do is have one single method that you use every time you have sex. Every sexual encounter is unique. Great sex is about communication and paying attention to how your partner responds. Watch for the sounds they make, changes in their breathing, muscle contractions and body movements.

## Breast Play
One technique that works on many is to simply brush your fingertips lightly and slowly all over the breasts. Think feather-like strokes, where they can barely sense any pressure. Explore the entire breast area… from the top where they begin, to the bottom or underside of the breast, around the outer and inner sides and up over the areola. For people with bigger breasts, the underside where the skin starts folding under to meet the torso can be extremely sensitive, so doing this can make them melt in ecstasy when stimulated right.

Some like a more aggressive touch. You can cup their breasts and give them firmer squeezes and a light sort of kneading motion overall. When it comes to the nipples you can rub or pinch them lightly and pay attention to how they respond. Some enjoy the really hard pinches, tweaks and pulls while others can’t quite handle that intensity. It’s all about communicating about what feels good for her and how far you can push it. For the ones that like the more extreme nipple play, you may want to consider a pair of nipple clamps.

Feel free to also explore the breasts with vibrators, feather dusters, ice, candle wax (designed for this type of play), whipped cream (or any other safe, edible product), and anything else that intrigues the both of you. Talk about this before you do it to make sure you’re both on the same page.

Feel free to also explore the breasts with vibrators, feather dusters, ice, candle wax (designed for this type of play), whipped cream (or any other safe, edible product), and anything else that intrigues the both of you. Talk about this before you do it to make sure you’re both on the same page.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">When it comes to mouth play on the breasts, again, start gently and work your way up in your intensity. Kissing, licking and flicking your tongue over her breasts and nipples and then lightly blowing over the wet areas add a mixture of hot and cold that can send their back arching. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Sucking the actual nipples feels great for some and does absolutely nothing for others.</mark> If they don’t enjoy a straightforward suckle, add a bit more pressure with your tongue as you swirl it around their entire areola.  
You may want to add gentle nibbles as well. Some like a firmer tooth grip around the erect nipple, but this can cause pain to others. Make sure you discuss what they like and slowly work your way up.

If the ‘boob player’ has a penis, another thing that both partners can get pleasure out of is a “tit job”. Even if the breasts you’re playing with are really small, it can still be pleasurable. The nerve endings make it feel great for them and the visual aspect can be arousing for everyone involved. It’s definitely best for you to use some lube or oil to get the breast area good and wet before the penis slides in. This will allow the receiver to get a lot more pleasure from the act. Some people aren’t a fan though, so be sure to ask before going for it. And if the penis is long enough or the receiver can get their head low enough, they can add in a little oral action at the end of the penis’ thrust.

## Anal Sex
### Anal 101
Be prepared. If you can’t handle the off chance that there’s going to be a little bit of poo still in the rectum, then anal play is simply not for you. That said, as long as you’ve “prepped”, there shouldn’t be any mess. The key is to let your digestive system decide when you play. If you have a proper balance of fibre and protein in your diet, your poo should come out nice and firm. When you wipe and there’s barely anything left on the toilet paper, you’re good to go!

Have a soak in the tub or a shower but do not put soap in your anus! That will burn! No need to put any water in it either. If you really feel the need to, then no more than an ear syringe worth of water is needed. Many people choose to use enemas before anal sex, but I do not advocate their use, as it can wreak havoc on your digestive system. Another really good option that many people rely on is using a female condom for anal play. You remove the inside ring and put the condom in the anus, while leaving the outer ring right on the outside of the sphincter. Put some lube in it and you’re good to go! This also allows for you to move from the anus to other parts of the body without having to wash off in between!

Make sure your nails are short and you’re not wearing any rings. Start with your normal way of getting aroused. Put on some porn, read erotica, come up with a fantasy in your head and start playing with yourself as you normally would. This gets you in the mood and your body becomes prepared for sexual play. Lying on your back tends to be the most comfortable position for anal self stimulation. Bring your hand towards your anus and just play around with the sphincter area. It’s one of the most sensitive areas around the bum, so a light touch is all you need at first. At this point, some people prefer to put on a glove or a condom around their finger.

Start adding lube in. You seriously need it for anal play to be enjoyable. Use it and use lots of it. And remember to keep reapplying it every few minutes, as the lube gets absorbed into the colon or pushed up higher into the rectum, where it doesn’t do you any good. No need for a special “anal” kind. Water or silicone based will do. If you’d prefer to do anal play in the bath, then you’ll want to use silicone based (be careful when you stand up afterward, though). Start to massage the anus with a bit more pressure. For males, it’s a good idea to externally massage the prostate with your other hand at this point, by rubbing your perineum. Once you’re ready for insertion your finger should literally slip right in. No force or pressure should be required. If it won’t go in, it means you’re not ready (not aroused enough or comfortable/relaxed). Give it time and don’t rush or force it.

Once you’re inside, keep your finger shallow and just move it around in circles, feeling the walls of the anus. Focus on massaging the walls of the rectum as you slowly move deeper in. You may enjoy slow thrusting in and out at this point, as you continue to rub against the sides of the anus. Stimulation tends to be a bit different for males and females, since males have a prostate to stimulate but girls don’t.

Women: It’s not as straightforward for us since we don’t have a prostate gland to stimulate. Play around with different motions and discover what you find to be pleasurable. Keep exploring the walls, using circular movements as well as thrusting motions. You can also rotate your finger around as you do this. See how deep you like to go, as well as what speeds work best. Many like to keep it gentle and slow, but others like to be a bit more aggressive. Mix the different motions up as much as you can to learn what you enjoy best.

It’s important to note that anal play on your first time might not feel all that great. It takes time and practice before you start to get the hang of it. Toys are commonly used for anal stimulation, but it’s best to start with your fingers.

What does anal feel like compared to regular PIV?
>It took me multiple sessions to get pleasure out of it, though I never found it outright painful and we’ve always gone slow, used lube, and had me “push out” as he entered to make it easy.  
I’ve now found that if I’m in doggy and he pulls my hair so my back is quite bent, I can feel him against my fornix when he’s in my ass. It’s not enough to cum from it alone but it is nice. And for me there’s a mental component in enjoying him dominating me but this might not apply to you

>But it feels INTENSE. It feels really good, like toooo good for a second and then - wait - did I just shit everywhere? No I didn't, okay continue. Feels good and so full and... I'm pretty sure I just pooped. Nope, guess not.  
It's that, happening over and over for me x100. I can't truly enjoy myself because it feels like I am taking a shit most of the time. I never once did poop during it. But it terrifies me and it outweighs the pleasure. You should try it though if you're curious. Get a guy with a smaller dick and go slow with lots of lube. It's a totally different feeling. Some people like it, some don't. It's a mental thing for me and I can't let the pooping thought go lmao

---

The key is the proper warm up as well as lots of lube. Start with your usual foreplay methods, stimulating each other’s non-anal erogenous zones.

Once you’ve had fun with that and are fully aroused, the giver/top should work their way towards their partner’s anus with their tongue and/or fingers. Stimulate the bum my massaging, stroking, licking, and kissing it and work your way inward towards the sphincter. Follow the same steps of Anal 101 with your fingering technique and getting them relaxed and comfortable. Be sure to reapply more lube whenever necessary.

After a bit of fingering, it’s a good idea to progress to a toy that’s a size or two smaller than the man’s penis (or with lesbian couples or pegging, the biggest toy/strap on that you’ll use). Remember what you learned from [anal toys](https://web.archive.org/web/20140209061843/http://www.sexpertslounge.com/2011/08/19/sex-for-noobs-anal-toys/ "Sex for Noobs: Anal Toys"), in terms of what types of objects to use as well as which one may be best suited for you. If there’s any pain at all when you insert the toy it means that your partner is not ready for penetration and you need to stop and go back to foreplay. There’s absolutely no rush at all. You need to take it as slow as necessary for your partner to feel comfortable. Once you’ve played with the toy and they’re really enjoying themselves, you’re good to progress to sex!

It’s recommended that you use a condom for anal sex. The most obvious reason is to prevent STIs, but it also prevents the giver from getting a UTI (due to the anal bacteria being pushed up the urethra). There are also <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">rare cases where the guy ejaculates in the girl’s ass and then the semen spills out into the vagina and gets the girl pregnant. </mark>Again, rare, but still a notable risk.  
Now condom or not, you need more lube at this point. Put it on the penis as well as on the receiver’s sphincter.

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Even though they’ve been properly warmed up with fingers and toys, you still need to go slow, since it’s another size up.</mark> It’s best to just start with the tip of your penis and let the receiver/bottom decide how much deeper to go and the speed with which to proceed. It’s usually best to start off in either doggy position with the receiver backing up onto the penis (instead of being thrust into) or in cowgirl so they have full control of the movement. Some prefer to give slow, gentle thrusts at this point, with no more than the glans of the penis entering the anus. Others prefer to slowly make it all the way in before adding any thrusting action.

Either way, be sure to communicate with your partner on how it feels. Again, if there’s any pain, you need to stop and start from the beginning. As they enjoy it more and more you can increase your speed as well as the power behind your thrusts. Some girls can take quite a pounding with anal, while others need it to stay gentle. The best way to angle yourself during anal sex tends to be with the penis pushing down on the front anal wall (towards their partner’s bellybutton). This way it stimulates the recto-uterine pouch in females and the prostate gland in males. It will also stretch the perineum, which creates more pleasure.

Throughout this whole process, feel free to stimulate your partner’s genitals. If you’re with a girl, rub her clit, play with her breasts or use a toy to penetrate her vagina. If you’re with a guy, play with his penis or nipples. Just about any position works for anal, it just takes a bit of practice with your angling. So experiment with what positions work best as well as what secondary stimulation your partner enjoys (it might not necessarily be one of the more “obvious” erogenous zones).

Finally, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">whatever you do, never put your penis in a girl’s vagina after you’ve been in her ass. If you want to go back to vaginal penetration, you need to change the condom or wash off first (soap and water or a good rub with a baby wipe) to prevent her from getting an infection.</mark>


## [Sex positions Link](https://sexinfo101.com/positions)
**Fuck like you have a big dick, even if you don't.**  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">When you enter her, slide in slow, and just enough to feel the wetness. Back out, and then back in a little deeper. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Repeat that process until you finally feel it slide completely home. </mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Don't get lost in your own sensation, no matter how good...think of your cock as a finger with which you are touching her inside</mark>.  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Don't just jackhammer away, hold her tightly, and deliberately thrust inside her.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Bury yourself to the hilt, and hold it there for a second, pressing into her as hard as you can.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">If you're in a missionary position, adjust your position so that you're "riding high", with your pubis pressing into hers.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Shift your hips as needed, and add some side to side motion, so that you're touching her in different places inside as you move together.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If you're in a position where you can reach, touch her vulva and clitoris while you're moving inside her.</mark>  
In all of these things, remember all the previous tips...talk to her, pay attention to her body's responses, and take your time.


## Early Ejaculation/ Premature Ejaculation(PE)
The average time a male-bodied individual lasts during vaginal or anal sex is 5-10 minutes. The DSM-VI that is coming out next year defines premature ejaculation as ejaculating within 59 seconds of insertion.

The best thing you can do is **kegel exercises.**  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Do them multiple times a day every day and you should be able to gain more control over your ejaculation, as well as experiencing stronger orgasms and harder erections. </mark>  
You can also practice certain exercises, like edging with the **start-stop technique** or **using the squeeze technique**.  
These are outlined in the article below. Most male-bodied individuals find that they can last longer after their first “round”.  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">So you can masturbate before partnered play, you can orgasm during manual or oral stimulation with your partner before going onto penetrative sex,</mark>  
or <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">you can reach orgasm during “sex” and then return to using your hands, mouth, and/or toys on them until you can get hard again and then go back in for more.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Many people have really long refractory periods and can only have one orgasm in a session and after that, they can’t get aroused again. If this is the case with you, talk to your partner and learn how you can both be satisfied with your sexual play.</mark>

However, it is important to note that f<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">or some, kegels can be counterproductive.</mark>  
For a lot of men, the trouble with PE is not that their PC muscle is too weak, but that it's too TIGHT.  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The PC/BC muscles tense upon arousal, and if they are too tight, they have nowhere to go, so they release the tension in immediate orgasm. </mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">This is similar to what would happen with a weak PC muscle, but in this case, it would happen no matter how strong the muscle is.</mark>  
Many PE forums recommend loosening and stretching of the PC/BC muscles to restore elasticity and blood flow to the tight muscles, and give them room to build arousal.  
Reverse kegels, yoga, groin stretches, and pelvic floor therapy are all recommended for this.  
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Either way, if you're doing kegel exercises you need to be doing reverse kegels as well or else it's like doing exercise without stretching.</mark>

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">I know it’s easier said than done, but the less you stress about it, the more likely you are to last as long as you want.</mark>  
You may want to get a check up with your doctor, just to be sure everything’s healthy and in working order. But it comes down to you not putting so much pressure on yourself to perform and just enjoying the sexual stimulation.

### Ways to Last Longer during Sex.
Here’s what the science suggests: 

**Use condoms.** 

First, let’s state the obvious: sensation reduction, the one “downside” of condoms, might be your most accessible solution. 

If you’ve tried corner store rubbers and still experienced trouble, there are many types of condoms designed to address PE. The most widely studied is the extra thick condom, which [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8899143/) to prolong erection and even enhance its intensity. 

Another option is a condom with local anesthetic to extend pleasure, like benzocaine or lidocaine. Just make sure to pause to allow the product to do its work (perhaps the perfect time to set the mood and put on The Playlist?). 

You can also purchase these topical agents separate from the condom, if you’d prefer. Which brings us to… 

**Embrace topical agents of change.**

Applying topical numbing agents might give you pause, but rest assured that they are safe for use (unless you have an allergy), and that [research](https://academic.oup.com/smr/article-abstract/8/1/92/6812664) supports their ability to… give you pause. 

Numbing agents have been proven effective for increasing partner satisfaction and, in technical terms, “the time it takes to eject.” 

A quick-dry [desensitizing spray](https://getmaude.com/products/stay-desensitizing-spray) makes the application pretty seamless, won't disrupt your mood, and allows you to build and adjust the number of sprays for desired effect. 

**Explore add-ons.** 

While using an actual dildo is a surefire way to make penetration last longer, there are many aparati [designed for penile stimulation](https://getmaude.com/products/band)[, too.](https://getmaude.com/products/band) 

You might be thinking: isn’t stimulation the culprit here? Technically, but it’s a lot more complicated than that. Context and location of stimulation may play a part. 

For example, [a 2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6859670/) found that alternative methods of masturbation was a promising therapeutic approach to PE. The researchers claimed this could be for a few reasons, one being that the patients are getting used to this “uncommon stimulation style” that cannot be “easily duplicated by their partner's vagina.” 

In other words, simply adding stimulation outside of vaginal penetration can change the way your body functions. 

**Edging.**

Edging, or slowly working towards orgasm and then stopping before the climax, has been researched less than pre-sex masturbation for treatment of PE. 

However, intentionally getting to know the bodily sensations you experience before orgasm--and communicating your need to stop or slow down--is an excellent way to include your partner without killing the erotic moment. 

If you’re not exactly sure how to edge, [check out the basics.](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/the-basics-of-edging)

**Extend the pre and post.**  
Extended foreplay and aftercare are easy ways to make the experience of sex last longer. It's a time to explore different kinds of intimacy, even non-physical intimacy, or to isolate one partner's pleasure and focus attention there. Devoting time to the build up (and wind down) is a fun way to enhance a sense of closeness.

### Basics of Edging
_the pleasure of delayed gratification._

Imagine living eternally in the prologue phase of a sensation — on the brink of a sneeze, the peak of a roller coaster, the rising action in a Safdie Brothers’ film. The steady thrill of anticipation, knowing what’s to come. That, ladies and gentlemen, is called “edging.”

Sexually speaking, edging is exactly as it sounds: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The practice of slowly edging towards orgasm, getting frightfully close, then pealing back so as to put off the climax. </mark>Often described as an “**orgasm control technique” the intention is to prolong a sexual experience, ultimately intensifying the final sensation of orgasm when it _does_ arrive (it’s the whole ethos of “delayed gratification”).** 

That said, like all other modes of bedroom folly, there are a few things you might want to know before you get started: Potential risks, crucial techniques, hot tips, you get the gist. So, at a glance, here’s your **Edging 101.**

**What are the benefits of edging?**

In addition to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">prolonging your sexual activity, and potentially emphasizing the pleasure of your orgasm, edging provides a number of other worthwhile benefits.</mark>  
For one, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">it’s reported to help improve sexual stamina in all circumstances — which is to say, even when you’re not actively participating in the project edging, you’ll still enjoy lengthier trysts. </mark>Moreover, according to the [Journal of Sexual Medicine](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31361-8/fulltext), edging can be a highly effective tool in helping folks learn their partner’s bodies, _and_ explore their own bodies.  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">When the end goal of a sexual encounter is _not_ rapid-fire orgasm, it allows more time for folks to get comfortable investigating what turns them on, and what doesn’t.</mark> And last but not least, a [2019 study](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(19)30992-0/abstract) from the _same_ journal indicated that, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on average, women finish 8 minutes later than men during intercourse.</mark>  
In that vein, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">incorporating edging into your sex life with a partner can help sync your orgasms, thus aligning you closer in your sexual experience.   </mark>

**How do you edge?** 

There are a number of popular techniques when it comes to mastering the art of edging — and there’s no limit when it comes to exploring in your own time. But in the realm of tried and tested approaches, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">most popular may be “the stop & start method.”</mark>  
Just as its title implies, whether you’re going solo or with a partner, you actively work towards the orgasm (with a toy, your hand, penetration) — then, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">when you feel close, you simply stop. Take a breather. Cool off — then start again. </mark>

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">For men,</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">“the squeeze method” involves squeezing the penis and holding it for 30 seconds between bursts of stimulation (rather than merely taking a break)</mark>, and for women, “ballooning” refers to the practice of performing kegels to slow or stop stimulation. 

If you wanna go straight up tantric (the practice of orgasm control has long been a part of tantric sex), <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">when you’re close to orgasm, you’ll want to pause, inhale, imagine your sexual energy moving up towards your head and out towards your finger tips, then return to stimulation </mark>— the ultimate goal being full-body orgasm.

**Are there any potential risks?** 

While plenty of message boards may complain of “blue balls” or increased inability to orgasm, all medical advice re edging speaks to the contrary. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">According to several doctors, voluntary delays in orgasm should neither hinder one’s ability to orgasm, nor lead to an uncomfortable or dangerous build-up of tension. Which is to say…..go ahead and live on the edge.</mark>

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When doing the stop and start method, you might feel like ejaculating as soon as you start again after a rest. This can be for one of two reasons:  
</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">You’re not resting for long enough. 30 seconds is ideal, but you may need a minute for your arousal to drop.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">You may be pushing yourself too close to the point of no return. In future, stop a little earlier until you can rest for 30 seconds before continuing.</mark>

#### How long You Should Aim to Last for
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If you usually finish in a couple of minutes, aiming for 20 minutes is a tough goal. </mark>  
It can be tedious and time consuming if you spend ages masturbating because you have to stop and rest every 30 seconds.

Breaking it down into smaller steps is more likely to motivate you to keep at it.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If you usually only last a minute or two, set yourself the goal of five minutes before ejaculation for the first few sessions.</mark>  
From there you can raise the goal to 10 minutes. Later, from 10 minutes to 20 minutes.

When you can hit each goal with only two or three rests, you’re doing well and can move to the next goal.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">And on the topic of 20 minutes – that’s not a strict target to aim for. I personally think 20 minutes is a good time to aim for based on how long surveys suggest women take on average to reach orgasm during sex.</mark>

For some people though, 20 minutes is way more than necessary. So feel free to set your own goals.

#### Having to Stop Too Many Times?

If you find you need to stop too many times to reach your time goal, either alone or with a partner, you can change the way you approach it.

Instead of stopping 10 times in 10 minutes, only do the process three to five times. Even if that only means a few minutes in total, eventually it will get better.


#### Part 2: The Stop and Start Technique with a Partner

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Practicing with your partner presents a more realistic challenge. It also lets them know you’re working on the issue and they might like to feel involved.</mark>

There are two ways to do it:

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Go straight into trying it during sex.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Practice with manual and oral sex, mixed in with normal sex on some days.</mark>

It’s up to you how you want to do it, but for those who want to start slowly, here’s a method to try:

- If you’re very sensitive, start with just kissing for a few minutes.
- Your partner can start to caress your body slowly and sensually.
- Ask your partner to masturbate you with their hand. If that makes you ejaculate quickly, this is the level you need to practice at for a few sessions.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tell them to stop before you reach the point of no return. Practice the stop and start method with them for the agreed time goal, before allowing yourself to finish.</mark>
- When you’re able to cope with your partner masturbating you, you can move on to oral sex.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">When you can last longer with oral, you can move on to sex.</mark>
- You might find that sex is too stimulating, even after developing control during manual and oral, so don’t rush. Spend time on foreplay and use lubricant to reduce the friction.
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Start with slow and shallow thrusts. You can even remain motionless inside your partner for a minute to let the initial intensity pass.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Each time you rest, just kiss or caress your partner. You could also pull out and give them manual or oral for a minute or two.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Continue slowly, with shallow, teasing thrusts.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">It might take many slow sessions before you can cope with more stimulating movements or positions. Just take things easy, build up and gradually increase the intensity.</mark>

#### Research Evidence that the Stop and Start Technique Works


More recently in 2020, a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7300103/) was published in which 50 participants were asked to practice the stop and start technique with a vibrating sex toy three times a week for six weeks. The results were quite positive, as the team reports:

> We found that a 6-week intervention consisting of vibrator-assisted start–stop exercises significantly reduced self-reported PE symptoms.
> 
> Ventus et al.

So, like many premature ejaculation treatments, it might work well for some men (myself included), but not for others.

I definitely think it’s worth trying though – it’s free, easy to practice, and in just a few weeks you should know if it’s working or not.


### How To Last Longer In Bed: 25 Techniques For Better Control

**The Techniques**
##### 1. The Start and Stop Method
The simple explanation is that you set yourself a time target such as 10 or 20 minutes. Then either during masturbation or sex, you stop and rest every time you feel yourself getting too aroused – until your time is up.

The idea is to learn where your ‘point of no return’ is and practice avoiding it by resting, or changing your position, rhythm, or speed. That’s why it’s sometimes called ‘edging’.

The trick is to learn how far you can push it in one position, speed, or rhythm before needing to stop. If you reach orgasm, you left it too late. If you need a long time to rest before starting again, try stopping earlier next time.

If you usually finish within a minute or two, 10 to 20 minutes might mean a lot of stopping and starting, which is fine. Stick with it though, and in a few weeks you’ll hopefully find you need fewer pauses.
##### 2. Try a Delay Spray
Using a delay spray is a great way to reduce the stimulation you feel, and can add many minutes to your lasting time.

I used one when I first started trying to deal with the problem, had excellent results with it, and found it was a great confidence booster.

The best thing is probably that it’s an instant solution, especially if physical sensitivity is your main difficulty during sex.

The downside is that it’s not a cure, and you’ll need to use it each time you have sex.
##### 3. Choose less Intense Sex Positions
Some sex positions are naturally easier to hold for longer; others will have you erupting faster than an Icelandic volcano.

Good positions are those that promote slower, shallower movements. They also tend to be ones where you don’t need to put in as much physical effort.

I know some men might find all positions are too intense, in which case I think extended foreplay in which you focus on your partner will help build your confidence. But if you do last long enough to have intercourse, keep these positions in mind.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">May be easier to last longer:</mark>
- The cowgirl – you lying down with her sitting on top.
- The reverse cowgirl – her on top facing away from you.
- spoons – her lying on the side and you behind her.
- Side by side facing each other – both of you lying on the bed, with legs intertwined.
- Sitting on the bed or in a chair – with her on top, you can relax more.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">May be harder to last longer:</mark>
- The missionary position.
- Any position from behind (apart from spoons).
- Most standing positions.
- Oral sex.

##### 4. Switch Positions if You Get Too Aroused
Changing sex position when your arousal is spiraling out of control is a great way to turn the temperature down a notch – at least for a while.

Another great trick is to completely withdraw and lavish your partner with your hand, tongue, sex toy, or anything else that they enjoy until you’re ready for action again.

##### 5. Masturbate before Having Sex
Another classic technique is to masturbate an hour or two before you have sex. It might sound simple, but doing this made a big difference for me. I still keep this technique in mind if I haven’t seen my partner for a few days.  
I don’t think the exact time beforehand is important. Just do it earlier in the day you think you’re likely to have sex so you’re less ready to explode when you next see your partner.  
If you have the kind of partner who likes to have long, lingering sex sessions and is happy to wait for you to recover, then why not get them to help you out?  
You can return the favor too, which takes the pressure off you to have amazing long-lasting sex the first time around. Then you can do whatever you enjoy doing together until you’re ready for action again.

Taking turns to try out some amateur massage is a great way to fill the time (and a good excuse to cover them in oil) .

##### 6. Go for a Second round
It’s very common for men to have less control the first time they have sex – especially after a gap of a day or more. Most mature adults understand this, so don’t worry if it’s all over quickly the first time.

Just be willing to continue the action with manual or oral stimulation. And when you’re ready for more, there’s a good chance it will be for considerably longer.

##### 7. Try the 7 and 9 Technique
This one is all about rhythm. Try to follow a stable pattern of 7 fast in/out strokes, followed by 9 slow in/out strokes. My partner is a particular fan of this technique, finding the rhythm enjoyable and exciting.

##### 8. Don’t Stop just because You Had an Orgasm
Sex should only end when both of you want it to end – not simply when you ejaculate. So if she’s still up for more, use your hands, [give her oral sex](https://www.risingmaster.com/how-to-give-a-woman-oral-sex/) or whatever she enjoys.

You might even recover in time for the second round while she’s getting even more aroused, increasing the chance of a mutual climax if you get the timing right.

I know this is similar to point six, but it’s so important that I think it’s worth rephrasing in a different way. The key point is to not think sex is over just because you came.

Your partner will tolerate your quick finishing a lot more if you give them some manual or oral sex, and stay awake for a second attempt.

Don’t make the rookie error of casually rolling onto them in bed, skipping foreplay, coming in a minute, rolling off, and falling asleep.
##### 9. Have Regular Sex to Get Used to the Intensity
Whether you’ve recently become sexually active, or have been for years, if you have sex regularly you should find you have better control.

I know from experience that when I have sex every day, my control is much better than when I only see my partner once or twice a week.

Obviously, it’s not always possible to arrange for sex to happen more regularly. But it’s an idea worth mentioning to your partner if they are invested in helping for both your sakes.

Practice makes perfect, as they say.
##### 10. Keep Calm and Breathe
If your breathing during sex becomes fast and shallow, or you start making more noise than usual while breathing, it could be a sign you’re getting closer to the point of no return.

Fortunately, you can reduce your arousal by controlling your breathing during sex. Breathe IN slowly for 4 seconds. HOLD for 4 seconds. Then breathe OUT for 4 seconds.

If you can maintain this pattern, especially when feeling more aroused, it can help you stay in control of your body.
##### 11. Relax Your Body
One of the reasons some positions are better for control is because it’s easier to stay relaxed in them. If you notice yourself tensing your stomach muscles, thighs, and glutes especially, then try to relax instead.

If you lie on your back with your partner on top, it’s easier to stay relaxed, and you should find you can breathe deeper and get back in control again.

##### 12. Relax Your Mind
Relaxing the mind is a trickier beast to pin down. According to sex therapists, if you go into sex worrying about finishing quickly, you’re more likely to do so.

So try using positive affirmations during sex to relax yourself. I know it’s easier said than done, but it’s not impossible. Tell yourself you’re a good lover, feeling calm, and that everything is just fine.

Alternatively, work on your general level of stress and anxiety in life. If you’re under a lot of stress at the moment, then doing meditation, yoga or relaxation exercises daily could make a big difference.

If that all sounds a little too esoteric for you, just remember the breathing. That can help with both bodily and mental relaxation.

##### 13. Wear a Condom
Unprotected sex feels amazing but can feel just a bit too good sometimes. Adding a condom can really help knock the sensitivity down a level, and give you a fighting chance of coping with the intense stimulation

Try an extra thick condom for even more desensitizing, or a special [delay condom](https://www.risingmaster.com/condoms-that-make-you-last-longer/) to add a little extra numbing.
##### 14. Use Plenty of Lubricant
The more lubricated your partner is, the less stimulation and pressure you’ll feel, especially when you first penetrate them, and so the longer you’ll last. It’s a good reason to spend plenty of time on foreplay.

Always have a bottle of quality lubricant to hand in case your partner doesn’t create enough lubricant naturally. If you’re pushing and it’s not sliding in nicely, get the lube out and make life easier for both of you.

##### 15. Focus on the Whole Body
You’ve probably heard the classic advice of thinking about something boring or unpleasant. In my opinion, this is a crap idea. It’s no fun thinking about unpleasant things during sex, and your partner deserves your full attention anyway.

Instead, try to focus on all the different sensations in your body, and your partner’s too.

Don’t allow your mind to get stuck thinking only about the sensation in your genitals. Think how every part of your body feels from your toes to your fingers. Enjoy the complete experience.

##### 16. Relax and Do Nothing
As I said before, relaxation is key. So much so, that relaxing to the point of doing absolutely nothing can help you last longer.

If you’re on your back you can try to totally relax and let her take control for a minute or two. Alternatively, both of you can simply lie still together with you inside and have a tantric moment.

This gives you a chance to focus on your breathing and lower your arousal level, as well as connect on a more profound level.
##### 17. Vary Your Speed and Depth of Thrusting
If you go at it hammer and tongs, you’ll ejaculate sooner – it’s as simple as that.

Women also like variation. Sometimes thrust slowly, sometimes pause deep inside her, sometimes do very shallow thrusts and tease her at the entrance.

Personally, I’ve found that it helps to mix two things. Sometimes I’ll stay deep inside, and then only move in and out a little, so the depth is maintained.

And then I’ll almost totally withdraw, only moving my penis head in and out very slowly. I might then do a few very slow shallow thrusts, followed by a very slow and deep thrust.

##### 18. Refocus Yourself Physically
This isn’t my personal favorite, but I know some men say it helps. Any small repetitive action with your body can help shift your attention from your groin. For example, gently curling the toes on one foot repeatedly.

##### 19. Don’t Start off Hard and Fast
At the beginning of any sexual experience, the pleasure can be overwhelming. Take it easy when you first penetrate your partner – get used to the pleasure and build up slowly.

If you can get through the first couple of minutes without too much stimulation, you might go longer than with a frenzied start.

##### 20. Count an Action
This is a variation on the classic distraction technique, and better than thinking about paint drying.

Try counting your thrusts or your breath, or anything else which is easy and rhythmic to focus on. Not my personal favorite, but again, some men say this technique helps.

##### 21. Spend Longer on Foreplay, with a Focus on Your Partner
This is one of the most important tips I can give you, stemming from the basic concept that men often get aroused faster than women.

The longer you spend on good foreplay (giving her as much pleasure as you can think of) the better.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">First, it takes the pressure off you, especially if you give her an orgasm first. Second, it raises her arousal to be closer to yours, so you may not even need to last so long when you do eventually have sex.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Finally, surveys show time and time again that many women wish that foreplay lasted longer. </mark>I also know from personal experience of talking openly with different partners, that they always like lengthy foreplay.

Sure, a quickie is exciting from time to time. But that’s no excuse for always skipping foreplay so you can get to the main course.

##### 22. Talk to Your Partner about it
If you talk openly about having problems with your sexual stamina, it will take the pressure off you. You can then work together and many of the techniques in this article will be easier to implement.

I recommend doing this with positivity and a sense of humor. I’ve actually experimented with the way I tell women I have a ‘problem’. They always react better when I frame it with smiles, laughter, and jokes than when I get all serious and vulnerable about it.

I don’t mean to ridicule yourself or be flippant. It’s more about keeping it lighthearted and showing you’re aware of the problem and in control of working on it, and it doesn’t have to be in awkward silence.

##### 23. Explore Tantric Sex
Tantra has a lot to say about the way people have sex, and how there are other ways to go about it. It’s worth looking into as one of the core teachings is about slowing everything down.

One idea you can try now is to spend time massaging your partner before you get to more sexual foreplay.

She may love you for it, and perhaps make her more likely to want sex more often if she’s currently avoiding it due to your quick finishing.

##### 24. Kegels and Reverse Kegels
Kegels are potentially very useful for ejaculation control, but it’s important to understand how and when to do them correctly (read [my article about kegel exercises](https://www.risingmaster.com/kegels-for-men/) for full instructions.)

The idea is to develop your pelvic floor muscles through exercises you can do in your own time. The muscles used are identified by stopping yourself mid-flow when peeing.

That same squeeze/contraction is something you can then do to stop yourself from ejaculating just before it happens.

You can also learn to keep the same muscles relaxed during sex up until that point of ejaculation. By actively relaxing that pelvic area, either through general relaxation or [reverse kegels](https://www.risingmaster.com/reverse-kegels/), you might find you last longer.

##### 25. Consider Talking to Your Doctor
I’ve left this until last because I know many men don’t feel comfortable about sexual problems with their doctor.


### Sex Positions That Help Me Last Longer (Or Not) During Sex#### How Can Position Choice Help You Last Longer?

In my experience, and from researching what sex therapists advise, there are several reasons position choice can help:

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Some positions allow deeper penetration and faster, harder thrusting. </mark>This can make a guy ejaculate sooner.
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Other positions make deeper or faster movements difficult, encouraging slower sex with shallower thrusting.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Some positions allow you to stimulate your partner’s clitoris more. This can potentially help her reach climax sooner, increasing both of your satisfaction.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Changing positions regularly gives you time to take a breather, and allows your arousal level to lower a bit.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If you feel yourself getting close to the point of no return, changing position could stop you ejaculating in that moment.</mark>

#### The Best Positions for Longer Sex
##### 1. Spooning Position
###### How
In the spoons, or spooning, position you both lie on the bed facing the same direction.
###### Why
- It’s harder to actually achieve penetration, often taking some time.
- When lying in this position, you can’t thrust as quickly or hard.
- The position allows slow, powerful movements which feel great but don’t overexcite.
- You can reach around and stimulate your partner’s clitoris with your hand.
- You can wrap your arms around your partner or caress them. This increase in intimacy can be very erotic for a woman.

##### Alternatives
**Side by side –** still both lying on the bed, this time you face each other. It takes some careful maneuvering to penetrate, and again only allows shallow movements.

**The cross –** here you stay in the same position as spooning, but your partner is on her back, at 90 degrees to you with her legs draped over the top of your thighs.

**Any perpendicular positions –** any variation you can think of that keeps you in a perpendicular position might help. These positions tend to put less pressure on the penis head – the most sensitive part.

##### 2. Woman on top
###### How
As the name suggests, this position is all about you relinquishing control and letting her be the one one top. Whether she sits up with her knees either side of you or relaxes into your embrace is up to you.

###### Why

- You can physically relax in this position, taking the tension out of your pelvic floor muscles that can lead to quicker ejaculation.
- If you [practice reverse kegels](https://www.risingmaster.com/reverse-kegels/), this is an easier position to do them in.
- Your partner can find a position to grind, stimulating her clitoris and raising her arousal.
- You can still use your legs and hands to control her movements and keep them slow and shallow.

##### Alternatives
**Lying still on top –** if you can find the balance, have her lie completely on top of you. You won’t be able to do much movement, but it’s an erotic position to rest in for a while.
##### 3. Reverse cowgirl###### How
Again, your partner sits on top, but this time angles herself so she’s facing away from you.
###### Why
- Like the woman on top position, you can keep your body relaxed, particularly the pelvic floor muscles.
- By facing away you remove eye contact, which can sometimes help to reduce the emotional intensity.
- Women in this position sometimes like to do smaller thrusts rather than harder movements.
- You can stimulate her anus manually if she enjoys it, increasing her pleasure.
##### 4. Sitting in a Chair
###### How
I think the name speaks for itself here! You sit in a chair with your partner sitting on top of you, facing towards you, or away from you if you like.
###### Why
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">This position doesn’t encourage deep, fast or hard movements. It tends to be slower unless she has her feet on the ground</mark> and has other ideas!
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The time it takes to get off the bed, find a chair and get yourselves in position can be a valuable cooling-off time for you. </mark>  
  So try not to carry her from the bed with you – take advantage of the chance of a complete break, however short.

##### Alternatives
**Sitting on the bed –** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">if you sit up in bed with your back to the headboard, or even kneel in the center, your partner can position herself on top of you.</mark>  
**Sitting anywhere –**<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> take advantage of the chance to cool off. If you decide to take things to the living room or kitchen, it gives you precious seconds to drop your arousal down.</mark>

#### Positions to Avoid
##### 1. The Missionary Position
The missionary position is probably the most common position globally. Many religions and cultures saw it as the cleanest, purest position that was acceptable for reproduction and not simply having fun.

Unfortunately though, in my experience it always leads to sex being over quicker than I’d like it to be.
###### How
Your partner lies on her back, you prop yourself up on top of her and gaze into her eyes as you penetrate her.
##### Why it doesn’t Help

- You can achieve deep, fast and hard penetration in this position.
- The sense of masculine domination might be too exciting for some guys.
- The position makes you tense your stomach, thighs and pelvic floor muscles more. This could lead to you having less control over your ejaculation.
- If your partner caresses your body with her free hands, it can raise your arousal.
##### Better Alternatives
**Limit penetration –** if you enjoy being on top, try doing much shallower and slower thrusts. You can also pull out completely, and use your penis and hand to tease your partner’s clitoris.

**The wrap –** prop yourself up on your elbows and forearms rather than in a press-up position, and get her to wrap her legs tightly around you. This stimulates her clitoris more, and keeps you from accelerating into 5th gear.

##### 2. Doggy-style
Doggy-style, in so many ways the most pleasurable, is also understandably one which can get guys racing to the finishing line in record time.

It allows for very deep penetration and encourages faster motion. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">So alternatively, have your partner lie down instead of being on all fours. You still get the pleasure of rear entry, but won’t be so tempted to get carried away.</mark>

##### 3. Standing Positions
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">In my experience, standing up leads to bigger erections, which leads to more stimulation and quicker ejaculation.</mark>

Many standing positions are also just very exciting and can lead to deeper and faster rhythms.

So my opinion is to generally avoid standing positions. Perhaps for a short while it’s fine as a cooling off position change. But I can’t think of any variation that will help your stamina.

### How To Do The Squeeze Technique
The squeeze technique is a self-help technique that might help some men with premature ejaculation.

The sex therapists _William Masters and Virginia Johnson_ came up with the idea decades ago, but it’s still regularly discussed as a method that men can use to stop themselves from ejaculating too soon during sex.

I’ve tried many different techniques in the past, and I’ll say from the outset that the squeeze technique isn’t my favorite, even though I have successfully used it during sex.

I find it a bit uncomfortable and awkward to do, as you basically <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">need to pull out and squeeze your penis head fairly tightly for it to work. It’s a bit dramatic, so I prefer more subtle techniques </mark>like the [stop and start method](https://www.risingmaster.com/the-start-and-stop-method-key-to-curing-premature-ejaculation/).

#### How to Do the Squeeze Technique

![squeeze technique picture](https://www.risingmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/squeeze-technique-picture.png)

##### The Correct Finger Positioning
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">She should place her thumb on the frenulum, which is the string-like piece of skin connecting the head of the penis to the foreskin.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The first and second fingers are placed on the opposite side, i.e. the front side of the penis that you see when you look down at it.</mark>

They are placed on either side of the coronal ridge, which is the ridge of the tip of the penis a few centimeters from the very top, but with the fingers still next to each other on either side of the ridge.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Your partner squeezes your penis with her fingers in that position for several seconds. She needs to squeeze quite hard, and probably won’t naturally apply the right strength through fear of hurting you.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If that’s the case, you may need to guide her by putting your hand over her fingers and showing her how hard she can squeeze without hurting you.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">You may lose some of your erection because of the squeeze, which is completely normal. Your partner should then wait 15 to 30 seconds after releasing the squeeze before starting to stimulate your penis again.</mark>


If you want to practice the technique on your own, see if you can achieve the same finger positioning yourself.

You may need to bend your wrist in a slightly uncomfortable way for it to work. If you can’t do it, you could try experimenting with your fingers the other way around, though this isn’t technically the way to do it. Still, if it works, it works!

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Doing it on your own can also be helpful in working out how many seconds you usually need to hold the squeeze for before the feeling of needing to ejacuate subsides.</mark> That way, you can tell your partner to aim for that length of time when they do it, or until you simply ask them to stop squeezing.

Again, some experimenting and quite a few attempts will probably be needed to get the timing and positioning right.

#### Practicing Ejaculation Control

In the next stage, ask your partner to masturbate you up until close to the point of nearing orgasm, and then use the squeeze technique as described above.

The key is to make sure you do it at the right time, which isn’t always easy to pinpoint at first. With practice, you’ll get better at understanding the right time to do the squeeze.

It’s a bit of an art form getting the timing right, so you’ll have to experiment a little and probably be prepared for a few timing mishaps at first.

If you find that you instantly feel like ejaculating when she starts again after each rest, you probably left it too close to the point of ejaculation. If so, try to stop and do the squeeze a little earlier next time.

The idea is that the technique will buy you time each time you do it and rest, not that you end up painfully hovering around the point of ejaculation.

You can repeat this process either 4-5 times or for a period of 5-10 minutes – whichever comes first. Remember to allow an enjoyable ejaculation and orgasm at the end of the session.

After practicing this technique over 3-4 different days, you can move on and try it with oral sex. Finally, after 3-4 days of practicing during oral sex, you can attempt ejaculation control with full penetrative sex.

When having full sex, it’s recommended that you use the squeeze technique 2-3 times first during foreplay before having sex and continuing to withdraw and use the technique.

#### How Often Should You Practice It?

The squeeze technique takes dedication on both your and your partner’s part. It may be then that you only practice the technique once or twice per week whilst continuing to have normal sex on other days.

It’s important to still have a natural sexual relationship whilst practicing this and other techniques.

Stick with it though, and you could start see good results even in your normal sexual encounters with your partner.

## Am I Pregnant? Scenarios:
- We had unprotected sex (no condom, no birth control), but I did not ejaculate in her at all

> This depends on when your last ejaculation was. If it had been around 24 hours or more _and_ you'd gone pee a few times since your last one, then the chances are incredibly small. If you'd recently ejaculated, then there's a good chance there was sperm in your precum that can get her pregnant. Still at the lower end of risk, but definitely possible to get pregnant. Get emergency contraception to be on the safe side. And start using protection (even if it's just learning how to use the withdrawal method properly and coupling it with fertility monitoring).

- She gave me a handjob/blowjob and then I cleaned myself up and then fingered her

> Unless you didn't wash your hands or at least give them a good wipe off before playing with her vulva, you're fine. Oxygen kills sperm and sperm also die if they've been dried out. So unless you're going straight from having semen on your hands to fingering her, you're safe. If you think there's a good chance that you had semen on your hands when you put your fingers inside her, and she is not on birth control, then get an emergency contraceptive.

- She's on her period, so she hasn't ovulated yet, and I ejaculated in her

> Get emergency contraception. If ejaculated into the vagina, s<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">perm can live for as long as 7 days inside her.</mark> So while she hasn't ovulated yet, she can still release an egg in time to meet with viable sperm.

- We were dry-humping. I didn't ejaculate

> The risks are small and depend on what you were wearing. If you were naked, then the risk is higher. If you had enough pre-cum and had ejaculated recently and not urinated, then the risk is higher, even if she was wearing panties. If you were wearing jeans, you have nothing to worry about.

- We were dry-humping. I didn't ejaculate

> The risks are small and depend on what you were wearing. If you were naked, then the risk is higher. If you had enough pre-cum and had ejaculated recently and not urinated, then the risk is higher, even if she was wearing panties. If you were wearing jeans, you have nothing to worry about.

- I gave him a blow job, I swallowed his cum, he kissed me, and then he went down on me.

> You're fine. You're not going to get pregnant from that. The only way you're going to get pregnant from oral is if he ejaculates in your mouth, you immediately snowball it back into his mouth and he immediately goes down on you while pushing the entire load into your vagina.

- We had sex with a condom on. I ejaculated and stayed hard so I took the condom off and did a few pumps in her without a condom on before grabbing a new condom.

> Get EC. Without wiping off, your penis would still have semen on it that you have just pushed into her vagina. While the risks or pregnancy are lower, they still exist.

- We had sex with a condom on. I ejaculated and then did a few more pumps with the condom on before taking it off.

> Did you notice any semen being pushed out, over the top of the condom? If not, you're fine. If it did and you're pretty sure that it actually got inside her, then get EC.

## Fingering
Before you even think about doing anything, you need to make sure your nails are trimmed and your hands are clean. Also, just like with handjobs and the glans, you don’t want to just dive straight in for the clit. She needs to be properly warmed up before you can even touch her button. The best advice anyone could give is to just experiment with different strokes and finger movements and pay close attention to how she responds. When she reacts strongly, keep note of it, as that’s the area you’re going to end up focusing a bit more on. I find it easier to write this article as a step by step guide, but please don’t take it as exact directions. Pick and choose the techniques you want to try and vary the order if you think it will work best for you and your partner.

Begin by exploring the area around her vulva. A woman’s inner thighs and pubic mound tend to be extremely sensitive, so explore them using soft kisses, licks and strokes. Use your fingertips to explore the soft areas around her thighs. Bring your hands to the crease that connects the outer labia and her legs. It’s incredibly sensitive and may respond to the smallest touch. The sides of the fingers can feel great against this spot. Gently run them up and down it before slowly bringing your fingers inward to start rubbing or stroking her outer lips. Some girls like it if you give them a little squeeze together as you gently pull them out and away from the body and then rub them back into the body. Work your way to the inner labia, rubbing them with firm pressure and rolling them between your fingers, one hand on each lip. The inner lips tend to be more sensitive than the outer ones so take your time and just tease and play with her.

Once you have her lips warmed up, you can move onto the entire vulva. Press your whole hand down on it and rub in a slow, circular and up and down movement.[  
](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327022209/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clitoris_anatomy_labeled-en.svg)Some girls enjoy their urethral meatus being played with (the area between the clit and vaginal opening), so explore that whole area before moving in for the clit.

[![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327022209im_/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Clitoris_anatomy_labeled-en.svg "Clitoris Anatomy")](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327022209/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clitoris_anatomy_labeled-en.svg)Stay away from her clit until you know she’s fully aroused and ready. You’ll know she’s at this point when it starts to swell. Also, remember that the clit is much more than just the little nub (glans) that pokes out from under the hood. The shaft that’s attached to the nub follows along the hood and then it becomes wishbone shaped and runs down along the sides of the vulva.

Take the entire vulva by holding the outer lips and squeeze and roll it together to stimulate the wishbone part of the clit. You can also take the inner or outer labia and start rubbing them against the clitoral hood so the glans of the clit can be indirectly stimulated. Start using more pressure as she becomes more excited. When you hone in on the clit itself, just stimulate it over the hood. Try slow circular motions with the pad of your finger or a gentle side to side flutter motion. As she becomes ready you can speed things up.

When she’s good and wet (or properly lubed up) she’ll be ready for penetration. Start with just pleasuring the very entranceway of the vagina. It tends to be one of the most sensitive areas of the vaginal canal, so running your fingers around it and massaging the opening may be very pleasurable for her. When she’s ready, try bringing your middle finger inside her with your palm up. This way you can keep your thumb on her clit.

Stimulate it as your middle finger moves inside her vagina, feeling the walls, with a slight up and down and side to side movement. Don’t simply shove your finger(s) in and go to town with pumping them straight in and out of her. Women need to be warmed up, teased a bit and just played with. No just ramming it in! Once you’ve gotten her used to your finger in her, insert another finger, go a little deeper and find her g-spot. It should be 1-2 inches in and is located on her front wall (towards her belly button). Massage the g-spot using a “come here” motion with your fingers as you continue to rub her clit with the other hand. You should feel the g-spot swell and that’s when you can use firmer, more aggressive movements on it. If she says she feels like she has to pee, you might have a squirter on (around!) your hands. Tell her not to hold it in and just let it go. If this makes her uncomfortable, just make sure she goes pee before you try it again and she’ll know there’s no way she needs to go pee that badly again. If you want more advice on how to make your girl squirt (and some more advanced fingering techniques), check out [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327022209/http://www.sexpertslounge.com/2011/06/28/how-to-help-a-partner-squirt/ "How To Help a Partner Squirt") by Patient Polyamorist.


Keep in mind that any of the techniques listed can be used in conjunction with your tongue (once you’re ready to try oral). It may also take a few tries before you get to know what your partner likes. Pay close attention to her breathing, any sounds she makes, the rise and fall of her belly and muscle contractions in her abs, thighs and vagina. These are all signs that you’re hitting the right spots on her. Another great way to know what your partner likes is to watch her masturbate. It doesn’t matter if she masturbates on her back or stomach, just watch the technique she uses and see if there’s any way for you to mimic some of the moves she does. She may want you to just put your fingers in and let her take charge by grinding on them. You may also want to incorporate toys like vibrators into your fingering play. Make sure that no matter what you’re doing, you’re communicating with each other about what feels good and what isn’t making the cut. Simple words like gentler, harder, slower, faster, higher up, lower down, etc. can help her direct you where to go

### **What Do I Do to Help My Partner squirt?**

It is true that everyone is different, and as always, you should pay attention to your partner in case they’re giving you feedback. That said, this is one of the more universally applicable sexual techniques I have learned.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Use your shoulder and chest muscles to do the work, not your forearms. This increases your strength and stamina.</mark> Give yourself leverage by straddling her torso or sitting/kneeling alongside her north of her hips. Don’t sit between her legs.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327033313im_/http://www.sexpertslounge.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/55.jpg "Anatomical Chart")  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">After she is ready to go, put the ring and middle finger of your dominant hand inside her, with the pads of facing her clit.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Bend your fingers to form an “L” at the knuckle closest to your hand, pressing down on her perineum with the short side of the “L”.</mark>

Your fingertips will feel her G-spot. Alternatively squeeze this spot into her pubic bone using the top one-third of your fingers and stretch the opposite wall using the short section of the “L” you made.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">During your “down stroke,” push down toward her anus about one inch. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">During your up stroke, simultaneously pull your fingers towards the outside of her body with a come here gesture.</mark>

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">This stimulation needs to be rapidly alternated at a rate between 90 and 120 beats a minute. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">You will begin to hear a distinctive squishing sound coupled with a vacuum sucking sound – this is your hint that you’re doing it right. Her g-spot will swell.</mark>

As she gets close to orgasm, she may start to clench on your fingers with her vagina. If she does this, remind her to relax or even push. She may complain of a sensation of needing to pee – you may need to remind her that she just peed minutes ago.

If she was turned on and hydrated when you started, and can relax and let go, she should gush  1-6 ounces of fluid with continued stimulation of 3-5 minutes. She should be able to squirt again just minutes later.


## Spicing Things up
Once you’ve had lots of practice with foreplay and sex, you might want to add some new things in. Most people tend to work their way up from “vanilla” sex to the more kinky activities. It’s all about staying within the boundaries where you and your partner feel comfortable as well as keeping an open mind. As you build more trust and feel more comfortable with your partner, you may find yourself willing to do things you never thought you’d be interested in trying.

One common thing to add into a variety of sexual activities are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">blindfolds.</mark> When a person isn’t allowed to see, their other senses take over and the feelings become more intense. They also allow a person to escape into their own thoughts and relax into the act a bit better. Blindfolds can be used with any of the activities mentioned in this article.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Light bondage</mark> is one of the most common things for people to try when they want to change things up a bit. Whether it’s with a scarf, handcuffs, rope or any other restraints, tying you or your partner can be a lot of fun for everyone involved. Being bound tends to be viewed as a submissive act but the bound person can be the dominant one, simply by telling their partner exactly what to do to them. You can tie arms or legs to bedposts, table legs, or any other object that works for you. Some people like just having their arms bound behind their back or even in front of their body.

Just make sure to check in with them once in a while to make sure the position they’re in isn’t becoming painful. Once the person is tied up, try to stimulate every inch of their body with as many different sensations as you can think of.  <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">It’s all about teasing them until they can’t take it any more. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The items listed below can also be a lot of fun to use on someone who’s tied up.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Food play</mark> can be a lot of fun in the bedroom. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Keep in mind that it isn’t safe to put anything with sugar in it up a vagina, as it can cause some pretty serious yeast infections.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It’s also recommended that anything the girl agrees to put up herself is very long and easy to grip. When it comes to anal play, never ever stick anything into your bum unless it has a bulbed end (i.e. something impossible to insert completely).</mark>  
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Food play doesn’t have to go near the genitals to be fun. Things like whipped cream, chocolate sauce, fruit slices, and products specifically designed to be eaten off someone’s body can be put anywhere before being sensually licked/sucked/nibbled off them.</mark>  
Use these items to help discover new erogenous zones on your partner. You can also use mint to add some new sensations to oral.  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Try popping a sugar free mint in your mouth or gargle with minty mouthwash before going down on them.</mark>

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Ice can be fun to incorporate, especially for a really hot, sweaty session.</mark>  
For safety reasons, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">don’t use ice directly out of the freezer. Let it start to melt a bit before using it</mark>.  
Keep moving the ice around and don’t let it stay on one spot too long or it can cause damage.  
A fun way to start off is by just passing the ice cube between the two of you while kissing.  
Then one person can keep it in their mouth and give the other cold kisses and licks all over their body.  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">You can also place it directly on your partner’s skin and trace it along their body; front and back. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">A good thing with ice is that it’s safe to use on the genitals.  
Go down on your partner with a cube in your mouth. With men, you don’t want it to be too cold or they may not be able to maintain an erection.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Feathers or flower petals</mark> are another way of adding different sensations to your usual sex routine.  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Lightly stroking your partner’s body with them in a painfully slow and teasing manner can send them over the moon.</mark>  
You can also lay a feather or petal on their body and move it around with your breath.  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Whether it’s a single feather or an entire feather duster, a full intact flower or just a petal or two, running them them over every inch of skin can arouse your partner in ways that they’ve never experienced before.</mark>

People that are a bit more adventurous may want to try wax play. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">There are candles you can buy in sex stores that are specifically designed for sexual play. They melt at a lower temperature so they won’t burn your skin.</mark>  
You just drizzle the wax onto their body to create a completely new sensation of pleasure for them. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Adding ice play to this can really get you going.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Role play</mark> is another way of spicing things up.<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;"> If you’re in a monogamous relationship it can be a way to escape the familiarity of your partner and make it feel like you’re with a whole new person</mark>. Talk to your partner about the fantasies they may have.  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The more common ones are master-slave, doctor-nurse-patient, teacher-student, boss-employee, cop-prisoner, hooker-john, movie characters, or even pretending you’re complete strangers.</mark>  
If you want to take it a step further, go out in public (a club, bar, park, etc) and “meet” in character there. Make a whole scenario of it and stay in character the entire time.  
Have a safeword beforehand so you can always use it if things become uncomfortable. That way you can feel comfortable taking the fantasy as far as you discussed without any worries about whether your partner is actually acting or not.

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">A few more things you can to do to switch things up? Change the location where you have sex. </mark>  
If you’re always on the bed, go to the floor, the couch, a table, a chair, the car, somewhere outside, etc.  
Add in some toys to use on each other – vibrating cock rings, anal bead/plugs, vibrators/dildos, fleshlights, etc.  
Turn some porn on that you both enjoy and watch it while having sex or just copy everything they’re doing in the film.  
Give each other lap dances and strip teases with new lingerie/sexy outfits you’ve bought for yourself or each other. Anything that keeps you and your partner on your toes and eliminates the predictable routine that you may have found yourself in after some time together.

### Sex Games
>Not board games, but really fun "games" nonetheless:

- Slave for a night: The "master" gets to command the sex slave for the rest of the night (or day!) - doesn't have to be completely sexual either, i.e. massages, have the slave soap and lather you up in the shower, etc. Also have fun controlling the slave's orgasms - get him/her to masturbate until you say stop, he/she is not allowed to cum until you say so.
    
- Naked all the time: Either one or the both of you has to be completely stripped naked once you enter the hotel room - no clothes allowed for the entire day. A variation on this can be slowly stripping throughout the day - start the day off fully clothed, and with each passing hour, one or the both of you have to take off one article of clothing.
    
- "Forced" orgasms: Have a "competition" to see who can make the other cum first when 69'ing - have a "punishment" or "reward" for the winner.
    
- Orgasm denial: In contrast to forced orgasms, edge each other to brink of frustration - first person to beg for release "loses" - again can enact a punishment/reward.
    
- Roleplaying: so many options here - maid/master, student/teacher, secretary/boss, prostitute/buyer, Dom/sub, etc.
    
- "Stranger" hook-up: A fun roleplay if you ever plan on leaving the hotel room - plan out a place to meet up in advance (i.e. bar, pub, club, etc), dress to impress, and go out (separately) - roleplay a scene where you two are actually strangers looking for a one night stand and you want to take your partner home for the night - i.e. she can play coy and you have pick her up, or you both can just have fun flirting with each other.

## How-To" Guide for Men on How To Dominate a Woman in Be
### **Gentle Dominating**

### **Getting More aggressive...**

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Light scratching: Use your fingernails and scratch along her back or lightly dig your nails into her ass.</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Spanking: Slap her ass. Mix it up, don't just spank her a billion times: spank, rub it with the palm of your hand, grip it with your hand, slap it, etc. "I fucking love your tight little ass". "This beautiful ass is all mine...in fact I think I should leave a mark so you'll remember who it belongs to _slap_".</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Biting: Bite her nipples, alternate with licking and swirling your tongue around the nipple.</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Orgasm Denial: "Do you want to cum?", force her to say yes, then "I want to hear you beg for it." She begs. "Louder". She begs some more. "Good girl..." Proceed to make her come. </mark>

"I want to feel you soak my fingers/cock/tongue with your delicious juices".</mark> "I fucking love making you come, I think I want to do it again..." _Make her cum again._
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Have sex with clothes on. Ideal if she's wearing a dress/skirt - hike up her dress and fuck her like that. If she has pants, rip them off roughly. Move her panties aside (but don't take them off!) and screw her like that. "Look how wet you're making your panties...what a dirty little slut you are."</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Make her pleasure you. Force her on her knees and suck you off</mark>. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Get on your knees now." "You're going to suck me until I'm satisfied."</mark>  
  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">"Suck me with that talented little mouth of yours."</mark>
    

### **"Rape"/Light BDSM**

- So please, please tread carefully with this section, by "rape" I mean <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CONSENSUAL non-consent</mark>, if at any time she says the safe word, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Pay attention to her body language - if it appears like she is not enjoying something or starting to hesitate, STOP IMMEDIATELY, ask her if everything is okay, MAKE SURE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY OKAY.  
  Again, please DO NOT continue if you have any doubts whatsoever. Constantly monitor her and your actions throughout this - remember your boundaries, STICK TO THEM. If you are interested in these activities, find resources and do your research, consult BDSM subreddits. Please, please play safe!!
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Gagging: Gag her with a piece of cloth, my personal favorite is when my boyfriend fucks me with my panties on, then takes them off, and shoves them in my mouth.</mark> (Because your mouth will be gagged, you must have a "safe gesture" as a sign to stop if things get too much.)
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Bondage:</mark> Buy rope, tape, handcuffs, four-poster bed restraints, etc. OR improvise and substitute with a scarf or belt. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Tie up her wrists behind her back (then force her to suck you off), tie her to the bed frame and tease her. </mark>  
  Safety point: NEVER leave someone tied up alone in a room (if you need to leave to go to the bathroom or anything like that, make sure you can hear her if she calls out to you. NEVER LEAVE SOMEONE GAGGED AND TIED UP.).
    
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Degrade her.</mark>  
  Call her a dirty little slut/whore/cunt/bitch.  
  "The only thing you're good for is to be fucked/satisfying me.  
  " Make her degrade herself "What are you?" "What are you good for?" "You're my slutty little whore. Say it.  
  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">" If she hesitates, punish her with a slap/spank.</mark>  
  "Not fast/quick enough. Let's try again. (Repeat the question/your demand)." If you're satisfied, "Good girl" or "That's better." If not satisfied, punish her until she gets it right. Make her call you "Sir" or "Master". Punish her every time she forgets to refer to you as that.
    
- In contrast to degradation (as pointed out by you guys!): <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Praise her for satisfying you so well and being _your_ "good little girl/slave". Tell her how pleased you are with her behavior and how good she's pleased you. Reward her.</mark>

**After care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your partner after - make sure she/he is okay, ask what things they DID NOT like (as well as things they did like), make sure you did not overstep your boundaries.  
Hug, kiss, hold, cuddle her/him, tell them you love them, etc, etc.**

### How-To" Guide for Men on How To Dominate a Woman in Bed PART TWO!!
So first things first, PLEASE, PLEASE discuss with your SO before you play, make sure you define your boundaries, and STICK TO THEM. It's always better for her to ask you to take things further later on, than for you to take things too far without her permission and ruin the experience and make her reluctant for her to want to try again! So establish boundaries, come up with a safe word (even if you don't think you need one...fantasies are one thing, actual enactment of them is another, she may not actually enjoy the reality of it once she experiences it so it's always better to play safe than be sorry!), and please be respectful of these boundaries. These kinds of activity require a great deal of trust from your SO, so please, please do not violate this trust.

Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT.

- **Take control of blowjobs.** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">When receiving a blowjob, instead of letting her do all the work, "face fuck" her.</mark>  
  Grab the side of her head and push her down onto your cock.  
  For beginners, don't push too far down.  
  For more hardcore individuals, push her down until it reaches the back of her throat.  
  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Pull out, look her in the eye and smile while stroking her cheek.</mark> Then ram your cock back down her throat. Repeat until satisfied.  
  "You should see how hot/slutty you look with my cock down your throat."  
   <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">For subs, make her do this on her knees. If she closes her eyes or looks down, tug at her hair or grab her chin so she's looking at you</mark>: "Eyes open/Look up, I want to see that pretty face of yours as you suck me."
    
- **Facials.** "What a pretty face you have...I think I want to see it covered in my cum". "I'm going to cum all over that pretty face of yours." Once you've proceeded to unleash your load all over her face, smear some cum over her lips and get some on your fingers. Make her lick it off. Take a picture.
    
- **Sex toys!** This could honestly be a thread in itself. Toys for bondage (i.e. rope, handcuffs, tape, blindfolds), spanking (i.e. whips, paddles - though you can easily substitute with household items, things like rulers, the back of a hair brush, a cooking spoon, a belt, etc), vibrators, anal toys, dildos.
    
- **Take control of her masturbation.** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Force her to touch herself but make it clear that she is NOT allowed to bring herself to orgasm</mark>. Get a remote controlled vibrator. Tie her up and use it on her - control the settings: bring her to the brink, then stop it. "How badly do you want to cum right now?" "Give me a good reason to let you come (let her stammer out some answer)...not good enough."
    
- **Submission.** <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Make her wear a collar. Tell her she can only move on her hands and knees unless you give her permission.</mark>  
  Command her in all aspects (i.e. "I want your eyes lowered unless I say otherwise."  
  "Look at me only when I speak to you." "I want you naked for the rest of the night, is that clear? Now strip") Make her confirm your dominance: After each command: "Do you understand me?" "Are you going to obey like a good little slave?" Make her thank you after performing certain tasks, this is especially fun in terms of punishment: "I want you to thank me every time I slap you, do you understand?" Reinforce your punishments "You know why you're being punished don't you?" (Make her give you the reason) "That's right, because you were a disobedient little bitch. Now are you going to do better next time?"
    
- **More intense "rape" play**: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Shove her face down into a pillow while you take her from behind. Hold her down by firmly pressing your palm to her back, or twist her wrists behind her back. Pull on her hair (again while in doggy style).</mark>
    
- **Slap her across the face** (this was previously in the Light BDSM but many redditors indicated that it's more medium/heavy): Slap her face with your hand (or cock), alternate with tender cheek cupping between slaps. My SO tends to use slaps as punishment (aside from the usual spanking): _slap_ "Don't disobey me again." _slap_.
    
- **Choking** (again was in light - should be here): <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Place your hands around her neck and squeeze lightly - never squeeze for too long, and make sure to constantly monitor her to ensure that she can breathe properly!! </mark>  
  <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Please NEVER put direct pressure on the front of the throat (trachea area). Use light pressure with your fingers or thumb along the side. </mark>PLEASE PLEASE research breath play if you are interested in this - I cannot stress the importance of safety, there are MAJOR risks engaging in this activity and it is not something that should be experimented with without knowing how to go about it!!
    
- **Make her clean you up after you cum:** <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">If you cum on your stomach, make her lick it up</mark>. "Make sure you lick it clean like a good slut, don't waste a single drop of cum." <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Or if you cum in her mouth:  
  "Make sure you swallow every drop of cum I give you."</mark>  
  Reward her with a kiss or glide a finger against her lips once she's swallowed: "Good girl."  
  "You're such a cum-loving little whore." Lastly, demand that she cleans your cock after she "made a mess by dripping her pussy juices all over it." (Not a good idea after anal play for obvious reasons - instead, wipe your cock across her breasts/stomach)
    

**Edit: Adding one thing to spice it up even when you're NOT in the bedroom.**

- **Leave some nice hickies on her body. "I'm going to mark you so you remember who you/this body belongs to."**
    
- **If you had sex with her panties on (refer to Part One), after you're done, pull up her panties tight into her crotch and run your fingers down the outline of her slit. Tell her she's going to wear the panties for the rest of the day so she can remember what a dirty/good little slut she's been. Tell her you WILL BE checking that she obeyed when you see her later tonight, and if you found out that she didn't keep them on, you will be punishing her. Make sure you do this when you/she gets home from work. Praise her for being such an obedient girl when you see that she still has them on.**

**Edit 2: in terms of after care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your girl after - make sure she's okay, ask what things she DID NOT like (as well as things she did like), make sure you did not overstep your boundaries. Hug her, kiss her, hold her, cuddle her, tell her you love her, tell her how lucky you feel that she trusts you enough with taking control, etc, etc.**

### PART THREE: My "How To" Guide for Ladies WHILE Their Man is Dominating Them
- **Sounds:** Moan, whimper, gasp when your man is rough-handling you. Let him hear how turned on he's making you.
    
- **Beg for it.** Vocally: "Oh _please_" Him: "Please _what?_" You: "Please, I want you inside me/I want you to fuck me." Gasp/whimper out his name. Body language: show him how desperate you for him, move your hands across his back/chest, put your arms around his neck, press your body tight against his. When you feel his erection, glide your hand down the front of his pants and feel him through it, whisper in his ear: "I want _this_ so badly."
    
- **Don't let him do all the work:** When he's on top, wrap your legs around his back to bring him deeper. If you're not restrained by him, keep your hands on him, run it across his back/chest, through his hair (use light fingernails if he likes that sort of thing).
    
- **Shy kisses:** I like doing this when my guy is being particularly rough with me. I'll give him gentle kisses, on the mouth, on his cheek, along his neck and collarbone. This feels amazing when he gets more aggressive, it's like the more gentle I try to be with him, the more he'll assert his dominance as if saying "none of that bullshit, I call the shots." So I'll try to kiss him gently, but he'll just grab the back of my head and turn it into an aggressive kiss. Incredibly hot. It's very hard to explain the mentality behind this one, but it's like the more rough he is with me, the more I want to please as if to see if I can get him to be "gentler" when I really want the opposite ;) But it gets me into that nice submissive mindset that I really have no control.
    
- **Let him dominate you while YOU are on top:** Me and my guy like to do a lot of different positions during sex. Often times, he'll just say "Get on top" or "Ride me", and will shove me on him. He places his hands on my hips and controls me by thrusting upwards and shoving me down on his cock. Great position to lean over and moan/whimper in his ear while he's thrusting into you. Other times, he'll make me please him by being on top. "Ride me", then he puts his arms behind his head and smirks up at me, while I do all the work. At this point, show him how desperate you are to please him. This is the time when I really like doing the "shy" kisses cause I can lean over him and kiss him gently on the lips/neck.
    
- **Being disobedient...on purpose:** Sometimes it's no fun being the perfectly obedient little slave...how else am I going to get punished? ;) So often times I will disobey on purpose...I do this by:
    

1. In BDSM play: Taking too long to obey an order, outright refusing an order ("Please _no_"), purposely making a mistake (Him: "You're nothing but a dirty little cum-loving slut whose only good for being used. Repeat it." Me: "I'm nothing but a little cum-loving slut whose only good for being used." Him: "You forgot "dirty" _slap_ _spank_ "Try _again_."), not referring to him appropriately (i.e. "Master").
    
2. In "rape" play: Resisting - try to "fight" him off, struggle. Keep your legs closed tight, this will force him to FORCE them open. Use your hands to push him off - this will make him pin your wrists down. While I'm doing this, I like protesting: "No, please _no_". "I don't want to, please _stop._" Him: "Do you think I care what you want? Now shut up, you're here to do what _I_ want."
    

- **Blowjobs:** Suck him off as if there is nothing else you would rather do. Moan while you have his cock buried in your mouth (yes this may be difficult - but is possible when you're just playing with the tip). Use your hands (assuming they are not tied up) and pull his waist to you as if you are desperate to get more of him into your mouth. Do what your guy likes in terms of body language - i.e. if he likes your eyes lowered, keep them lowered, look up only to coyly ask him if you're satisfying him, or if there's anything else you can do to please him.
    
- **Beg to please** _**him**_**:** "Please, I want to suck you off", "Please let me suck you off", "Please, will you cum in my mouth/face/chest/stomach/pussy/ass?"
    
- **Remind him that he controls your orgasms:** Again more begging. "Please let/make me cum." "I need to cum so badly, please master." "I need you to make me cum, please I'll do anything." While saying this, show how desperate you are, rub your wetness against his cock or fingers, spread your legs wide for him.
    
- **Apologize when you're disobedient:** Beg for forgiveness "I'm sorry master. I didn't mean to. I'll do whatever you want, please forgive me." "I won't disobey/forget/struggle next time. Please don't be angry." "I'm sorry master. Please punish me for disobeying. I will be/do better next time."
    
- **Thank him:** Thank him for giving you pleasure/reward. And for letting _you_ please _him_ "Thank you for letting me suck your cock." "Thank you for letting me swallow your cum."

## Shaving
Hey there. Of course I can (try to) help and it definitely still applies to the topic of sexuality! It’s also an incredibly common “problem” and something that all genders experience. If you want to stick with shaving, that’s fine. But know that there are other options as well (waxing/sugaring, epilators, depilatories, or even laser).  
In terms of shaving, you need to start with a good blade. The longer you go without changing the blade of the razor you use, the worse the shave (and worse the razor burn/ingrown hairs).  
So get a good quality razor and blades that go with it.  
Use warm water in the shower/bath and let your skin soak in it for a while. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Use something like a loofah to exfoliate the skin. Some people like to apply baby oil to the skin before the shaving cream as it can help to soften the hair and skin. Shaving cream can also help to soften them, making for a smoother shave.</mark>

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Now that you’re ready to actually start shaving, go slow. Pull the skin tight, so there’s a smooth, firm surface to work on. Shave with the grain first. You want to use as few strokes as possible, so keep a firm hand. </mark>Once you’re done shaving with the grain and have as close a shave as possible, go over the area one time against the grain. This will give you the closest shave possible.  
Once you’re done and out of the shower, blot the area dry and apply some rubbing alcohol (to close the pores and kill bacteria).  
Deodorant can work well for preventing razor burn/ingrown hairs, so have a stick that you only use on your pubic area.  
Some people prefer spraying witch hazel or applying tea tree oil instead. There are also products you can buy that are specifically designed to help prevent ingrown hairs. Do what works best for you.When it comes to the hair on your shaft, you may actually want to pluck those. They tend to be more prone to razor burn and many men find it a pain to shave their shaft.  
Plucking actually doesn’t take as much time as you’d think and it’s not actually all that painful (especially after a few times).

One last thing to note: while sometimes a pain, shaving every single day is a huge help for preventing ingrown hairs, bumps/rashes, and redness. It also tends to give you by far the smoothest shave possible.

## Hygiene: How to Care for Your Nether Regions
The most obvious place to start is with washing. For men who are uncircumcised, many don’t know that they actually have to pull their foreskin back and wash around the glans of the penis in order to properly clean themselves. If they are unable to do this, or have never attempted to do so, they may have a condition called phimosis, in which the foreskin cannot be retracted.

When it comes to soap, you don’t want to use anything that’s fragrant or antibacterial. You also need to make sure soap doesn’t go up your urethra, anus, or (if you’re a girl) your vagina. It’s okay to soap up the outside areas (penis, the outside of the vulva, and around the anal sphincter) but it’s not healthy to actually bring the soap inside.

For girls – douching (when you push lots of water or douching products up into your vagina) isn’t a good idea either. The vagina has an extremely efficient self-cleaning system that requires a specific pH as well as bacteria present. So when you douche, you’re getting rid of the good bacteria and messing with the pH balance.

Anal douching or using enemas is also not recommended (for either sex). Again: there are really important bacteria in the colon, and douching can flush them out.  
If you use enemas too often you will start to rely on them in order to actually have a bowel movement. You also end up stretching your rectum out to the point where you mess up its system for ‘knowing’ when you need to empty your bowels. All you need to do to have a clean colon is eat a healthy diet, with a good balance of fibre and protein so that the poos come out firm and clean. Before you engage in a sexual act that involves the ass, go poo, then have a shower or bath. If you want, stick a finger inside yourself while you’re showering to make sure that you’re cleaned out. If you’re not, then just postpone anal play for another time when your digestive system is ready for it. If you’re really bothered by the thought of not washing your actual rectum out, you can use a small.

## **How Can You Improve the Taste of Your Vaginal Fluids or semen?**

Diet is your main means of ensuring you taste good.  
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">You need to drink plenty of water and stay away from fried foods. Asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, spinach, onions, garlic and red meat give your secretions a strong, sharp (bad) taste.</mark>  
Cigarettes, pot and alcohol make secretions taste bitter.  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The best thing to eat for great, sweet tasting fluids is pineapple (the fruit or just the juice)</mark>.  
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Other fruits like watermelon, strawberries, mango, kiwifruit, citrus fruit, papaya, cranberries and grapes work too,</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">but they’re not as ‘strong’ as pineapple.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Celery, parsley, wheatgrass, cinnamon, cardamom, fenugreek and peppermint give you a sweeter taste as well.</mark>


**Appearance**

Everyone has different preferences in what they find attractive in a penis or vagina. Don’t worry about the size, shape or colour of yours. It won’t matter at all to anyone who truly cares about you. The one thing that some people choose to alter, however, is their pubic hair.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Some like to keep it long and not do anything to it. Others prefer to trim it, as they think it looks neater and cleaner. This can be done with scissors or an electric trimmer. </mark>  
The length you trim it to completely depends on you and what you like. Another option is to completely remove all the hair. You can do this yourself with a razor or go get waxed.  
Another option for permanent hair removal is laser surgery. Depilatory creams like Nair aren’t recommended for the genital region.

Again: what you do with your hair is completely up to you, but you might want to talk to your partner about your personal preferences. However, keep in mind that if you would like them to trim or go bare, you need to be willing to honor their requests as well.

## Kegels
Real reason for caution: You can eventually get strong enough that as you flex, you can tear muscles. I have even heard of some people urinating blood after squeezing too hard, although I'm not sure if that's true or not. Point being, use common sense. Never squeeze so hard you are causing yourself significant discomfort or any pain at all. If you do experience pain, stop immediately, and allow the muscles to heal for a few days before continuing at a _decreased intensity_.


![pelvic floor muscles](https://www.risingmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pelvic-floor-muscles.jpg)

It’s somewhat confusing to understand, but there are three main muscles involved:

- Pubococcygeus muscle (PC)
- Bulbocavernosus muscle (BC)
- Iliococcygeus muscle (IC)

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Some online articles only talk about the PC muscle, but it’s actually the BC muscle at the base of your penis which is most important for ejaculation control.</mark>

At first, it may just seem like one large and weak muscle group, and that’s totally normal when you start out. In time you’ll get better at pinpointing different muscles rather than the entire pelvic floor.

Everyone knows how to flex their biceps or pecs. But tensing your PC or BC muscle isn’t something you can do in front of the mirror, and the visible results are much more subtle.

The easiest explanation is that the muscle you use is the same as the one you use when stopping yourself from urinating mid-flow.

So next time you go to the toilet, try to mentally squeeze the muscle at the base of your penis to stop the flow. If you can do it, or even just reduce the flow, you’ve found the right muscle.
### Aren’t There Different Types of Kegels?

When you see my weekly plan below, you’ll notice there are different types of kegel exercises. You still use the same muscle, but just training it in different ways, for example:

- **Quick pumps or squeezes** – when you contract or squeeze the muscle fast and then release. You can then do lots of these in quick succession.
- **Holds** – contract the muscles and don’t let go for a certain amount of time.
- **Reverse kegels** – instead of contracting, you actively relax. It’s almost like the pushing feeling you would have when squeezing out urine, or even a number two. More on that later.

### When, Where, how Often and how Many to Do?

Some people say you can do as many kegels as you like. I don’t agree with that though. Yes, you can do kegels in any place you feel comfortable, though it’s best to start in a private space.

But the important thing to remember is that they aren’t that different from other muscles; if you push them too hard, you can end up with tense or sore muscles.

When I first started doing kegels, I wasn’t told this and did them in vast quantities. And although I didn’t have any problems, some people have written to me saying that they did too many after reading other websites and now feel tight or sore.

For this reason it’s best to start out doing them every other day. Once you’ve built some strength and tone you can do them more often. But even then you should always rest at least 1 or 2 days a week.

And there’s no need to do thousands of them every session. You wouldn’t do that to your arms or chest, so there’s no need here either.

### When Do You Do Kegels during Sex?

Kegels are in fact a ‘last line of defense’ to hold back ejaculation. If you feel yourself getting too aroused, or reaching the point of no return, ideally you should take some other action, like changing positions or rhythm.

But if you don’t take action quickly enough, or you’re taken by surprise by your own arousal, then doing a kegel squeeze can help stop you ejaculating.

Then once your arousal subsides a little, you can rest, change positions or do whatever else you need to recover. Kegels are therefore not a single solution to premature ejaculation.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In fact, during sex you should be doing the opposite of the strong kegel hold: you should try to keep those muscles relaxed.</mark>  
That’s why it’s important to balance your exercise routine with [reverse kegels](https://www.risingmaster.com/reverse-kegels/) and relaxation in general.

The key is to develop a balanced control of your pelvic floor muscles.
### **What Can You Gain from Kegels?**

_Male bodied people:_

-Stronger orgasms  
-Potential to become FULLY multiply orgasmic.  
-Easier, faster, and harder erections  
-Greater orgasm control, both for delaying or triggering orgasm  
-Greater ejaculate volume  
-Increased sexual health  
-Ability to flex and stimulate your partner. (More for a smile and a "Wow" than for intense physical pleasure.)  
-Help to maintain erectile function as you age  
-Increased prostate health, decreased chance of prostate cancer  
-Increased libido (my theory, not proven)  
-Massively increased confidence because of all of the above

The pelvic floor muscles, abdominals, and anus all contract during orgasm in both male and female bodied people. 

**Kegels and your Butt:**

Kegels do not require anal play, or penetration. The fact that the anus contracts during orgasm has nothing to do with a person's desire to engage in, or not engage in, anal play.  
It is simply a biological fact. In order to perform Kegels properly, you will need to learn about how your body works. 

**Establishing the Mind-Body Connection with the Muscle Group:**

Right now, as you read this, contract the muscles that you would to stop the flow of urine, or to hold urine in when you need to go.  
If you are unable to do this, don't worry. Your body just hasn't established the mental connection with those muscles as strongly.  
In this case, wait until you are urinating. Once you have started, stop the flow of urine. You may not be able to fully stop the flow at first. Repeat the squeeze and release of those muscles a few times. 

**Feeling what the Muscles Do, Strengthening the Mind-Body Connection:**

Once you are able to do both <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the squeeze and push</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">do enough</mark> **squeeze, relax, push, relax**, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cycles that you feel you have good mental control of the muscle group</mark>, and can do them without your hands there to help focus. If you find you have lost some of that focus when you try your first 'hands free' session, just do some more 'hands on' work each time you are in bed until your control is good enough to be fully comfortable.

**The push is extremely important, it is the reciprocal of the squeeze.**  
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It is fully relaxing and extending those muscles, moving them through their full range of motion (and over time, extending that range of motion). </mark>  
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">If you are _only_ squeezing, you are progressively and repetitively flexing the muscle, without relaxing it. It would be similar to doing an arm curl with a weight, but only ever moving from fully contracted to 3 - 4" away from your shoulder. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">There is _very little_ benefit to doing 'half Kegels'.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">By exercising the full range of motion, you truly strengthen the muscle, and over time, extend it's range of motion</mark>.  
 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Also, for male-bodied people, you will use a combination of squeeze and push to delay orgasm during vigorous sexual activity.</mark>

**Kegels: The Exercise Routine**

So now you know how to perform Kegels, and you have good mental control of the muscles. Now it's just a matter of strengthening them.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The cycle is squeeze, relax, push, relax. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The goal is to squeeze harder, and longer.</mark>  
Start wherever you are comfortable, perhaps 2 seconds each, for 30 cycles.  
The stronger you are naturally, the longer you will be able to hold initially.  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">But no matter how weak those muscles are, they _will_ strengthen over time, so do not be disheartened if you can only squeeze or push for a second at first. Alternate your workouts:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Long Holds: Work up to holding each stage for 30 seconds, for as many cycles as you feel like.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Should aim for working up to 30 minute sessions. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">These are the principle strength building exercises, and are also good for developing orgasm delay control in male-bodied people.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Short Pulses: Squeeze for 3 seconds, and go directly into a push for 2 seconds. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Try for as many cycles as you can. As you get better, shorten the time to 1 second per cycle.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">These are amazing for directly strengthening orgasm intensity.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">They more closely mimic the rapid, rhythmic contraction of orgasm. They are not as good for increasing strength as the long hold type.</mark>

**Ok, cool. But how long before I'm a sex expert?**

While you will make incredible improvements over the next six months to two years, you will actually notice _huge_ changes within a week or two.  
_If_ you behave yourself and actually do them regularly, as in every day, ideally, or every second day.  
Also great news is once you've built up your strength over six months, or a couple years, you can chill it out a bit, do them twice a week to keep toned, and not really lose anything.

EDIT: Formatting (Why isn't there a 'preview post' function?

**EDIT 2: Many have asked for clarification on the push. I replied to the question in the comments, but thought I would add it to the post:**

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Some users have mentioned a similarity to pushing during a bowel movement. It is similar, but (and I have stressed this already), very, very different.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Do not push in the exact same way as you push a bowel movement. And do not push hard, and certainly not hard enough to cause a prolapse, as some have indicated.</mark>

This is the best explanation I can come up with:  
🌟  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Push exactly like a bowel movement for a second. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Now push exactly like pushing out urine for a second.</mark>  
 <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">It's kind of half-way between the two. </mark>  
 Now do a Kegel squeeze.  
 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">From relaxed state, you have contracted your muscles in a given direction. </mark>As you move from the squeeze, back to relaxed state, feel the way they are moving.  
 <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">From relaxed, the squeeze is a far larger motion than the push. </mark>  
 <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The squeeze may represent around 80 - 90% of the range of motion. </mark>  
 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">During the push, the degree of movement from relaxed will be much smaller. But it is incredibly important.</mark>

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not fully relaxing the muscles between each squeeze can cause all sorts of problems, and is actually worse than not doing Kegels at all.</mark> You're basically intentionally creating hyper tension in the muscle.  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The push, which is fully forcing the muscle to relax/extend in the opposite direction of the flex, and is so, so important, seems to never be mentioned. </mark>

### Reverse Kegels
#### Why Are Reverse Kegels Difficult?

The physical ‘how to’ is the part that people struggle with the most. It’s not easy working out which muscles to target, and even harder to do the right thing with those muscles.

There are three reasons I think men have problems with this:

- You haven’t done enough normal kegels, so you don’t understand the muscles involved.
- The movement you need to do is a bit strange, which makes you doubt it’s right.
- Knowing exactly when to do reverse kegels during sex is confusing in itself.

Many readers have left comments or emailed me in the years since first writing this article to say they aren’t sure if they’re doing it right. So I’ve since edited it to try and make it as clear as possible.

## First Learn Normal Kegels

The best way to identify the correct muscles is to first learn the normal version. Reverse kegels are targeting the same muscles, but in a more subtle way.

These aren’t muscles you normally have an awareness of, and it can take time to develop the ability to either squeeze or relax them.

So if you get the hang of normal ones, you’ll have a better chance of being sure you’re doing reverse kegels correctly.

## Reverse Kegels step by step

**Step 1**

Remember the classic kegel instructions about stopping yourself in the middle of peeing? This time, when you go for a pee try to gently force it out faster instead.

This is basically a reverse kegel of the key muscle – the [Bulbocavernosus muscle](https://www.risingmaster.com/locating-the-pubococcygeus-muscle-for-kegel-exercises/) – located at the base of the penis. You only need to do this once to get an idea for what it feels like. After that don’t try forcing out your pee any more and continue on to the next steps.

**Step 2**

Sit comfortably in a chair and relax for a few moments. Now gently try to simulate the muscle movement you would make if trying to do a poo or fart (don’t blame me for any accidents!)

This movement will be doing a reverse kegel of the Pubococcygeus muscle. Though it will also probably engage the Bulbocavernosus muscle as well.

**Note:** It’s unclear how important it is to be able to do a reverse kegel with both the front and back muscles. In my experience, the front one (Bulbocavernosus muscle) is more effective in controlling ejaculation.

However, it’s good to try to learn both as you may find that you need to focus on relaxing the entire area to develop any kind of control. Isolating them takes a lot of practice, so don’t worry if the whole area moves when practicing. Better control should develop naturally in time.

**Step 3**

Did you notice in both of these steps some movement in your stomach muscles, perhaps expanding or tensing? If not, do them again and you’ll probably notice some movement or tension.

This isn’t something to aim for when doing reverse kegels eventually, but it can help at the start to identify the correct movement.

**Step 4**

Now it’s time to add some breathing. Do the same steps again, but this time breathe in while doing them and allow your belly to expand. This is known as breathing from the diaphragm.

Most people breathe by expanding their chest. But you can also breathe by expanding your stomach instead. You might find that doing this helps you focus the movement on the BC muscle.

**Step 5**

Now you can put it all together. Do the simulated peeing and pooing motion, but also breathing out slowly from your belly, whilst keeping some light tension in the belly.

With the breathing and tensing, you should feel much more able to isolate the muscles and do a good reverse kegel. It does take practice though, so keep at it. You can try this for a few minutes a day until you get it right.

**Step 6**

Now for the really tricky part. Can you do reverse kegels without the help of breathing and tensing?

This can take a lot of practice, and even then you may never be able to do it without at least a little tension and stomach expansion. That’s fine, just try to reduce how much you rely on using the stomach to get the job done.

The key point here is that you need to be really relaxed. You need to mentally go inside your body and visualize the muscles relaxing and pushing out slightly.

Breathe slowly, deeply and relaxed while doing so, and try to focus on the area where the BC muscle is. Allow it to relax just by keeping your mind on it and trying to gently encourage it with your muscle control.

**Step 7**

Now’s the time for some real practice. While masturbating you can try to do 3 different things.

1. Do normal kegels and see what effect it has on your sense of control.
2. Switch to reverse kegels and see what happens to your physical arousal and control.
3. Then try to just relax the whole area.

There’s no set way to do this, and it involves some experimenting and creativity from you. In my experience, it took a couple of weeks of playing around with the concept 3 or 4 times a week.

Eventually, I discovered that keeping relaxed was best. And when I felt tension creeping in, doing a reverse kegel could help restore the relaxation.

**Step 8**

If you have a partner you can eventually try reverse kegels during sex. In my experience, it’s best to do it when you’re on your back and she’s on top.

That way you have the best chance of relaxing and isolating the correct muscles. Again, some experimentation with positions might be needed before you find the right one to help you focus and relax.

### Why Are Reverse Kegels Important?

This is an important point to remember: some men try to train very strong pelvic floor muscles because they read somewhere that it can stop them ejaculating.

Then they go overboard and try to hold the muscles as much as possible during sex. Either that or they think it gives them a better erection, so they continually pump the BC muscle during sex.

This is counterproductive though and encourages quicker ejaculation. Instead, normal kegel holds should only be done at the very last moment to try to stop yourself ejaculating. Or in the beginning to help yourself get a good erection.

If you’re trying to last longer, then at all other times during sex you should keep the PC and BC muscles relaxed. And doing reverse kegels is one way to accomplish this for three reasons:

- By training reverse kegels along with normal ones, you develop balance and control of the pelvic floor muscles
- If you aren’t able to keep relaxed during sex, then actively doing the motion of reverse kegels can help to achieve the relaxed pelvic floor you need to be able to last longer
- If you train it to a high level, you may be able to do reverse kegels so well that you can stop yourself ejaculating. You can do this before the point of no return and it’s usually more successful than waiting until the point when you need to do normal kegels.

So in some ways, you’re giving yourself two opposite weapons in the battle. You can do reverse kegels and keep relaxed as much as possible. Then if it all fails, switch to a normal kegel squeeze just before the moment of no return.

And finally, doing reverse kegels can help stop you from overtraining and creating an imbalance in your pelvic floor. So work on balance and control, not just strength.

### A Reverse Kegel Routine

Here are some ways to incorporate reverse kegels into a training regime with the normal version:

#### Plan A

You can do each normal kegel routine each day as described. Then at the end spend 2 or 3 minutes practicing reverse kegels.

So you could do this:

- Sit or lie down and relax for a minute.
- Breathe in for the count of 4 seconds and do a reverse kegel. Either with or without tension and belly breathing. Do whichever you can manage.
- Stop, relax and breathe out for 4 seconds.
- Repeat 9 more times, to make 10 sets.
- Do the same again, but this time breathing in for 6 seconds. Breathing out normally at the end of each 6 seconds.
- Now try and do the reverse kegel 10 times with normal breathing. See how much harder it is when you’re breathing out?
- Finally, hold the relaxed pushing out feeling for 30 seconds or as long as you can.

This is only a basic example routine, and you can add more sets and times to it as you get better at it.

#### Plan B

This time instead of doing the reverse kegels after the normal ones, you can do them alternately. Again it’s up to you to decide how to mix the sets, and it doesn’t really matter how you do it. Just don’t overdo it by doing it too many strong kegels.

#### Plan C

The final way is to do the normal kegal routine on one day, and the reverse routine either at a separate time the same day, or even the next day.

There’s no scientific evidence suggesting one way is better than another, so in my opinion you should aim for variety. Muscles adapt to training quickly, so the more you surprise them, the better the results.

### Still Having Trouble Identifying the Right Muscles?

Many readers have left comments saying they can’t identify the right muscle. The best way really is to focus on the muscle you need to use to make yourself pee faster.

Another way is to stand up when you have an erection. If you do a normal kegel, you should notice your penis rises. If you then do a reverse kegel, you should notice it drops downwards.

## Aftercare
You may be familiar with aftercare without knowing it: the practice of [cooling down](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/what-to-do-after-sex?_pos=14&_sid=a2f2b3bd1&_ss=r) after getting hot and heavy is not new, it’s something our bodies need after a bought of physical activity. What may be new, then, is aftercare beyond clean up and the requisite glass of water. 

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Aftercare refers to the deliberate post-sex practices that help both partners feel comfortable and reassured.</mark>  
The term originated in the BDSM community, where postcoitus can involve recharging after very physical sex, removing props, and verbal reassurance.  
However, sex-positive dialogue, from Twitter to [Tik Tok trends](https://www.thecut.com/2022/08/post-sex-aftercare-what-is-it-how-to.html), have encouraged that aftercare be practiced by _all_ people doing the deed. 

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">A good framework for understanding aftercare is thinking about foreplay: foreplay enhances intimacy between partners, makes space for focused pleasure, exploration, and even enables things like teasing, play, and talking. </mark>  
Foreplay sets the stage for the sex to be mutually enjoyable in that it is dedicated time for both partners to assess, and discuss, what they like and don’t like. 

Dialogue helps acknowledge this vulnerability. Even if it is simply naming something you liked (or something you want to change or try) during sex or complimenting your partner, this verbal reassurance helps both parties come down from the physical act while remaining intimate. 

Another approach for thinking about aftercare can be: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">what needs have to be met? Do you need to shower? Do you need to physically tend to yourself or your partner? Need food or water? While this shouldn’t feel like a to-do list, thinking through these basic needs post-sex can be a simple and effective way to make yourself and your partner feel cared for. </mark>It can feel as thoughtful, introspective, or playful as the moment requires. 

In the way that you may set a mood for sex, setting an intimate mood for **aftercare can be important too. Help your senses come down from a [big boost of oxytocin and dopamine](#) by creating a soothing environment.**  
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cuddle and enjoy some comforting touch, burn a favorite candle, play some calming music, opt for warm, soft light. </mark>

Beyond that aftercare is an experience that can make sex feel positive, complete, and validating, it is worth noting that many people struggle with feeling anxious or detached after sex, including those who suffer from postcoital dysphoria. Making a concerted effort to demonstrate care for your partner after intimacy does not just add something nice to the sex, it _is inherent to_ the experience of good sex. Like good foreplay, it sets dedicated time to check-in, and sets the stage for feeling understood.

### What to Do after Sex
**Snuggle a little.**  
Take a few minutes to snuggle with your partner and bask in that post-coital glow. It’s a great way to cultivate intimacy and strengthen emotional bonds, but also to revel in the endorphins that are already pulsing through your body as a result of good sex.

**Take a bathroom break.**  
Some doctors recommend urinating within 15 minutes following sex to help rid the urinary tract of bacteria and reduce the risk of UTIs. While there have only been a few [concrete studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2324774) conducted on the subject, it still can’t hurt to get into the habit. And while you’re at it, be sure to wash your genitals with a non-irritating cleanser or wipe to help keep things clean.

**Swig some water.**  
Hopefully by this stage of your life, you’ve learned the benefits of drinking plenty of water. And since there’s a good chance you worked up a sweat during your sex session, make sure to replenish those fluids by drinking plenty of water afterward.

**Give your partner(s) a confidence boost.**  
Everyone likes to hear when they’ve done a good job.  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Let your partner(s) know how much you enjoyed having sex with them and if there’s something they did that you found especially pleasurable. </mark>After all, open communication is one of the keys to a healthy sex life and good relationships.

## Toys and Vibrators
### How to Use Vibrators with a Partner
a vibrator is an excellent way to liven things up when you’re flying solo, but it can also be a memorable guest star during partner sex.

 If you’re using a vibrator with a partner for the first time, it can also be a good idea to use it on them first: Show them how it can enhance their pleasure, too, and make it a suggestion that will ultimately benefit everyone involved. 

It helps to frame suggestions positively: Telling your partner, “I like it when you…” gives them an idea of what they can be doing more of to enhance your pleasure.  
After all, intimacy involves both satisfying your own desires _and_ making sure that your partner is satisfied, too.  
Communication goes a long way—so don’t be afraid to ask what they like and to share feedback of your own. Just like with anything that you may try for the first time, using a vibrator with a partner may require a little experimentation before you figure out what _really_ works.  
Or, switching things up can help add a bit of excitement back into your sex life if you’ve gotten into too much of a routine. 

There’s no one way to use a vibrator with a partner, but if you're not sure how to get started, this guide can give you a few ideas. Ultimately, what feels best to you is a personal preference, but a bit of open-mindedness can help you learn more about what exactly makes you—and your partner—tick. Here’s how to use a vibrator with your partner.

#### The case for Using a Vibrator during Sex:

Sure, the use case for a vibrator during a solo sesh is pretty clear—but when you’re with a partner, bringing in another tool may seem unnecessary, or even awkward. But there are some real benefits to trying it out. First off, it’s fun. [Vibrators are designed to enhance pleasure](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/the-psychological-benefits-of-vibrators), so whether you’re using one by yourself or with a partner, you’re going to amp up sensation. Remember: Vibrators don’t have to be a substitute for or a replacement for a partner (in case you want them to be, of course), but they can be a great compliment.

Science backs this up, too. There’s research that shows that for some people with vaginas, clitoral stimulation (which can be accomplished through the use of a vibrator) is necessary to achieve orgasm. According to a 2017 article published in the [Journal of Sex and Marriage Therapy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1346530), only 18.4% of women studied could orgasm through penetrative sex alone—the rest either required clitoral stimulation or said that clitorial stimulation improved their orgasms. 

Of course, you don’t _need_ to use a vibrator for clitoral stimulation—going acoustic, if you will, can certainly result in a climax. But a vibrator can do a lot of heavy lifting during sex, to the benefit of both you and your partner. And even if orgasm isn’t your end goal, a bit of vibration can still make the experience more pleasurable and fun.


#### Find Your Sweet Spot.

When you’re figuring out how to use a vibrator with your partner, don’t be afraid to try things out.  
Our [erogenous zones](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/the-lesser-known-erogenous-zones) respond differently to stimulation, so what might work for one person may not do anything for someone else. That’s where a vibrator can help.  
Explore one another’s body by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">applying vibration in light circles to different areas like the neck, nipples, inner thigh, behind the ear, back of the knee</mark>, the testicles, shaft, perineum—even the armpit, scalp, and hands.  
The end goal here doesn’t have to be orgasm; <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">using a vibrator with a partner can be a great technique to add to your foreplay arsenal.</mark>

#### Alternate between Your Mouth and Your Vibrator.

Sex is all about sensations, which is why mixing things up every so often can make it even better for all parties.  
So, once you’ve identified the spot on your partner’s body that really gets them going, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">alternate between using the vibrator and the warmth of your mouth and tongue for an extra-sensory experience.</mark>

#### Use it to Enhance Oral Sex.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Vibrators aren’t just great to use during penetrative sex—they can also enhance sensations during oral sex.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">If you’re going down on someone with a penis, press the vibrator against your cheek for some extra stimulation.</mark>  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">During cunnilingus, you can insert the vibrator into the vagina to up your game even more. </mark>

#### Give Certain Positions a Boost.

Here’s how to use a vibrator in a way you might not expect:  
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Use it to stimulate the clitoris in positions where it might be difficult to do so. Think: reverse cowgirl and spooning. </mark>

#### Let Your Partner Take Over.

Giving up a little bit of control and letting your partner take over can bring an element of excitement to sex. One way you can do this is by having your partner lie on their back as you lie on top of them, with your back on top of their chest. As they hold a vibrator they can trail it across your body before bringing it to stimulate the clitoris. Then, ease in, and enjoy the ride.

#### don’t Skip the Lube.

[Lube](https://getmaude.com/collections/lubricant) isn’t just for penetration—while it’s formulated to reduce friction, [it can also intensify the feelings of a vibrator](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/lube-101). Think of it as making a good thing even better. Just make sure that you use the right kind of lube: Silicone lubes can cause silicone vibrators to degrade over time, so reach for a water-based lube instead. Start off with just a little bit, and don’t be afraid to reapply!

#### Bring it in the Shower.

There are plenty of ways to [make shower sex an even more enjoyable](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/how-to-have-shower-sex)—even exciting—experience. One of which is bringing a vibrator to the mix. As long as your device is waterproof (many are), you can use it for a little extra stimulation as the steam rises.

#### Practice Good Hygiene and Safety.

It _should_ go without saying, but it bears repeating: [Wash your vibrator](https://getmaude.com/collections/care) between uses with warm water and soap to keep it clean of any bacteria. This is important all the time, but especially if you use it with one or multiple partners. You may also consider using a condom on a vibrator to further protect against STIs, but just make sure your condoms are safe to use with your vibrator: Just like with lube, you won’t want to pair a condom that contains silicone lubricant with a silicone vibrator, as it can get damaged over time. Vibrators made of non-porous, medical-grade silicone are top-tier when it comes to devices that are body-safe and easy to clean.

#### Keep it Charged.

Here’s possibly the easiest way to prevent disappointment in bed: Make sure that your vibrator is fully charged so that whenever you want to use it, it’s ready. There are few let-downs quite like the device dying when you or your partner are _so close_ to getting there. So, get into a habit of cleaning and charging your vibrator after every use—it’s best to play it safe.

## How to Be Good at Sex
There’s hope: According to a recent [Tonic article](https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/bjavz5/the-rules-of-being-good-at-sex?fbclid=IwAR3QBRpYuBdkGMgiCSsdfut5unkLxrQLAhoqoXmzrROtYre3yafSmffjlKU), researchers have found that there are five things in particular that can help make you good at sex. Here’s how to up your game.

**1. Make your partner feel desired.**  
Encouragement goes a long way and sexual satisfaction is intricately linked with self-esteem. The better your partner feels about their body, the more likely they are to enjoy themselves. Whether it’s telling them how sexy they are, admiring their body through touch, or even just moaning appreciatively, try to let your partner know how much you desire them.

**2. Know their body (and yours).**  
Apparently, a lot of people still don’t know the difference between the vagina (the internal genital tract) and the vulva (the external sex organs). And there’s even sometimes confusion about the mechanics of a penis. So make sure you at least know the basic geography—and function of—the relevant parts of your partner’s body and how to stimulate them.

**3. Understand what your partner likes.**  
Your partner is always happier when you get them a birthday gift that they actually like, right? The same goes for good sex. They’re much likelier to enjoy having sex with you if you’re doing things that turn them on. And the best way to find out? Ask them.

**4. Don’t skip out on foreplay.**  
Sure, a smash and dash can be fun once in a while, but foreplay is one of the essentials to great sex—especially if you’re looking to cultivate intimacy with a partner. So instead of just getting right to the action, dedicate some time to warming things up slowly and setting the mood through kissing, caressing, and other manual stimulation.

**5. Change things up.**  
Just as foreplay is great for helping people get into the mood for sex—not all of us are ready to get down to it straight away—it also helps to keep things varied. Instead of going straight for the same boring old position every time, try a combination of positions, and alternate between oral sex and intercourse. (Remember that not everyone with a vagina is able to climax from penetrative sex alone.

## The Spectrum of the Female Orgasm
_why different women climax in different ways._

**Clitoral orgasm, G-spot, A-spot, U-spot** – there are many kinds (15!) of orgasm out there. Every person’s body is different. 

Of course, there are many factors that can change over a woman’s lifetime. While there is a lot at play when it comes to female pleasure, the fact that so many things determine how, why and whether we reach climax means that struggling to reach orgasm and one time or with one person might not be the case forever.  
The other good news is that <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">although men require a [refractory period](#) after orgasm before they can have another, women technically don’t... meaning that</mark>, **in theory at least, we can come, and come again.** Here we break down the hurdles of getting down.

**Numbers game**  
A deep dive into the number of orgasm types throws up a broad range of perspectives. During a megagasm it can feel as if a lifetime of pent-up emotion were bursting free – and it is. Your body feels open, with electricity streaming through,” Sprinkle writes. Holmes also hears that women experience mouth orgasms, nipple orgasms, and anal orgasms.

**Linguistics of getting laid**  
Generally, however, a common way of talking about women’s orgasms seems to put them into two categories: outside and inside. Or in other words, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">an orgasm that comes from stimulation to the external part of the clitoris or an orgasm that results from penetration.</mark>  
A [2014 study](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/women-do-experience-two-different-types-of-orgasm-study-reveals-9191884.html) found that these two types of orgasm do exist and are distinct: they provide a different type of pleasure experience for women.  
Another [2017 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28678639/), of over 1000 adult American women who had heterosexual sex, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">found that 7 out of 10 said they needed clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm,</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">while only 1 in 5 said they could orgasm from vaginal stimulation alone</mark>

**Biological Variables**  
Lots of factors determine what kind of orgasm you can or can’t have. Some women have a clitoris that is more sensitive.  
Other women have a G-Spot that is easier to access.  
A lot of women find it possible to make themselves orgasm through masturbation, but once with a partner, all kinds of other variables get involved: from position and time spent building up arousal, to trust and technique. These variables can affect the strength of the orgasm, too. 

**High stakes, low odds**  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It is estimated that 5% to 10% of women are not able to reach orgasm at all, even with ample stimulation.</mark>  
The technical term for this is “anorgasmia” and it can happen [for many reasons](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/body/article/48477/1/women-cant-orgasm-anorgasmia-sexual-health-wellness). [Some are psychological](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/on-sex-and-anxiety), such as performance anxiety, past trauma, stress, tiredness or body confidence. Others are physical, like experiencing pain during sex for example, while other women (like those who have experienced FGM, or trans women who have undergone gender confirmation surgery) might not be able to experience certain types of orgasm for anatomical reasons.

### Orgasm with a Partner
_sometimes the stars align just right._

[](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/orgasming-with-a-partner)Let’s get real: By no means should sex be measured by whether or not you and your partner(s) achieve orgasm. As we’ve mentioned before, there are [many ways](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/do-orgasms-matter) to enjoy sex without reaching climax—it’s about the journey rather than the finish line. But that said, sometimes, you do really want to reach that finish line. 

And sometimes the stars align just right and you can not only have an orgasm yourself, but at the same time as your partner.

We know what you’re thinking: surely that has to be some kind of sexual unicorn. Simultaneous orgasm does in fact happen, though not as often as most of us would like it to. But the right circumstances—and a little effort—can make it far more likely to happen. Expecting to orgasm at the same time as your partner is a highly unrealistic standard to hold yourself to, but it’s certainly worth some experimentation.

Switching things up in bed by using lube, spending more time on foreplay, and trying new positions can make it more likely that you and your partner climax at the same time. So, have an open mind. You never know when the stars will align just right.

**Do your homework.**

You’re better at playing an instrument if you know all the notes and chords and how they work together (obviously). The same goes for intimacy. You’re far more likely to achieve an orgasm if you know what turns you on _and_ you’ve communicated that with your partner. For instance, there are so many [lesser-known erogenous zones](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/the-lesser-known-erogenous-zones) that you might be neglecting—or you might really [benefit from some dirty talk](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/the-science-behind-dirty-talk) to get you going. It’s impossible to overstate the importance of communication when it comes to intimacy, your preferences, and [your boundaries](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/communicating-sexual-boundaries-in-a-relationship), but having a conversation with your partner will pretty much always benefit the both of you (they want to know how to turn you on just as much as you want to know how to turn them on). Talk about how and where you like to be touched and what your partner(s) can do to amplify your pleasure—and ask that they share the same about themselves. [Set the mood](https://getmaude.com/collections/candles) with lighting as you have the conversation, and then let things go from there.

**Beware the orgasm gap.**

Research consistently shows that women [experience orgasms far less frequently](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/the-elusive-female-orgasm) than men, especially during penis-vagina sex, so it’s important to keep that in mind. Since it may take a little more time for women to approach orgasm, you may need to place more focus on clitoral stimulation if you want to orgasm at the same time during penis-vagina sex. A [vibrator can help](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/how-to-use-a-vibrator-with-a-partner) with that: It can be especially helpful to use in positions that don’t typically involve a lot of clitoral stimulation, like reverse cowgirl and spooning. You can also [use a vibrator during foreplay](https://getmaude.com/products/vibe-personal-massager) to bring your partner closer to orgasm before penetrative sex. Or, you can climax at the same time even without penetrative sex through mutual masturbation. 

**Communicate.**

Talking things out isn’t just important before intimacy. During intercourse, keep one another updated (in the sexiest way possible, of course) on how you’re feeling and whether an orgasm is on the horizon. You don’t even have to overthink it—a simple check-in will do: “How does that feel?” “I’m close.” “Keep going.” “A little slower.” If one partner is outpacing another, slow down the stimulation a little to cool things down if your goal is to climax at the same time. You can also use this opportunity to switch positions or [try something new](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/on-real-talk) (like oral, or a vibrator).

**Don’t put too much pressure on a result.**

If you’re in your head too much, a simultaneous climax is going to feel even more impossible to achieve. One of the best parts of sex is that it can help you get out of your head and into your body. If you spend the whole time worrying about whether or not you and your partner will be able to achieve the elusive simultaneous orgasm, you’ll only set yourself up for failure and disappointment. Remember: Orgasm alone is a nice-to-have, not a must-have, and the same goes for simultaneous orgasms (especially!).

## Use Lubricant.

There are so many [benefits of using lube](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/lube-101). While it might most often be thought of as a tool for penetrative sex (penis-vagina sex or anal sex), it’s also a tool that can increase overall sensations during sex. That’s what makes it great to use with a vibrator—or even a hand. If your partner has a vagina and could use a little extra stimulation, [using lube](https://getmaude.com/collections/lubricant) can help to increase their pleasure, bringing them closer to orgasm. It’s also great for hand jobs and external clitoral stimulation. Think of it as an extra ingredient that can amplify all the sensations that you or your partner are already feeling. Start with a pump or two, and don’t be afraid to reapply.

**Try some new positions.**

Orgasming at the same time can be easier in some positions than others. Why? Different positions allow for different stimulation. It’s worth noting, after all, that research shows that fewer than 20% of women (specifically, those with vaginas, in [a 2017 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1346530)) can climax through penetrative sex alone. The remaining majority either require some kind of clitoral stimulation or say that clitoral stimulation has a significant impact on whether or not they orgasm. So, it makes sense that—for penis-vagina sex specifically—positions that allow for a bit more clitoral stimulation are more likely to result in that elusive partnered climax.

**The observer**

A [2020 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32044258/) of monogamous straight, cis women found that it took an average of about 13 minutes to orgasm. Conversely, [research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547548/) that it takes men between five to seven minutes to climax—which pretty much explains the disappointment that can arise after a “quick” finish. The solution: Start with one partner having a solo session as the other watches, before eventually joining in.

**Woman on top**

It’s easier for women to control the pace of sex while riding, which makes cowgirl a great position for achieving dual orgasms. Grinding can help to get some G-spot stimulation, but hands can also be helpful in this position: Don’t be afraid to multitask with some clitoral stimulation while you’re riding. 

**Mutual masturbation**

As previously notes, simultaneous orgasm doesn’t have to be achieved through sex at all. Masturbating with a partner can be just as fulfilling. You can do it in bed together, or [bring things into the shower](https://getmaude.com/blogs/themaudern/how-to-have-shower-sex) for a change of scenery that can up the ante. If you start by focusing on solo pleasure, you can pivot to pleasuring your partner with a hand job or some finger stimulation. Just remember to communicate your speed and pressure preferences.

**Doggy style**

If you or your partner enjoy G-spot stimulation, then doggy style is another great option for a simultaneous orgasm. You might want to lead up to it with foreplay or even missionary, and while you’re in doggy, you can try different variations. Some people prefer to stand with their partner in the front leaning over, with their back arched and legs close together, while others take it to all fours. And on all fours, you can also shift to a position that’s closer to laying down (with your legs outstretched). Don’t be afraid to experiment and see which variations result in the best feelings for both you and your partner.

**69**

It has a reputation for a reason. Oral sex, alone, is a great way to bring your partner to orgasm. So when you couple receiving with giving, there’s bound to be more fireworks. Don’t let this position intimidate you—try it out in bed in a position where both you and your partner are comfortable (some strategically placed pillows can relieve pressure on the neck of the person on the bottom and the knees of the person on top). Even if you don’t finish in a mutual climax, you’ll have tried something new—and that’s an exciting prospect in itself.

**Leave it up to fate.**

Ultimately, simultaneous orgasm isn’t something you can count on—but making an effort in the hopes that it does can lead to a great time. If it happens, it happens, but if one of you happens to orgasm before the other—or not at all—at least you’ll have fun while doing it. As always, communicate with your partner about your needs and theirs, and you’ll both find satisfaction in some way.


## The Best time for Sex
_a non-partisan look at the optimal hour for getting down._

Like with sweatsuits and bloody marys, there’s no _wrong_ time to have sex. But nevertheless, the age-old debate persists: Morning sex? Bed-time sex? Afternoon delight? Which hour reigns erotically supreme?

And while plenty of folks have made their cases over the years, it would seem that we’ve still yet to reach a consensus. So, in the interest of neutrality, we’re taking the time to outline the benefits of each: Morning, Afternoon, and Nighttime pleasure. Sure, we suggest you try them all. But without actually test-driving the variables, here’s what you ought to know:

**Morning Romp**  
According to [behavioral psychologists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/married-and-still-doing-it/201809/whats-the-best-time-day-sex), it’s standard for men to wake up already aroused. Apparently, sleep makes for excellent foreplay — so it’s not rare for men to prefer morning sex. That said, plenty of women find the morning to be the most erotic time of day as well. 

Whether or not you greet the day fully turned on, morning sex can help stimulate you before the workday. Those early endorphins can be key — nothing guarantees a better in-office Keynote presentation like a healthy dose of morning sex (or...we like to think so).  On weekends, then, mornings typically provide ample time. Brunch plans aside, you’re plenty well-rested, and you’ve got nowhere to be. 

**Afternoon Delight**  
Sure, the afternoon is often out of the question when we all report to respective workplaces. But that said, while enduring quarantine, perhaps you and your partner should consider a 3pm “coffee break.” 

As outlined in a [2018 study](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/25/the-best-time-of-day-to-have-sex-according-to-science/), 3<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pm has some serious erotic benefits. For heterosexual couples, mid-afternoon just so happens to be the time when women’s and men’s hormonal levels synch up: Men will hit an estrogen peak which can help them relate to their partners, and in turn, women will reach a cortisol peak, which can help to boost energy</mark>.  
In a lot of ways, it’s just _like_ a coffee break...if your daily caffeine intake requires penetration. 


**Night Moves**  
Unsurprisingly, this is the most common of the three — and with good reason. Evening is inherently sexy. You’ve got the whole _cover of darkness_ thing going on. Maybe you’re dressed up. Maybe you’ve had a glass of wine. You have plenty of hours before work tomorrow. Naturally, you’re in bed. 

Sure, you might be tired. It can be hard to set the mood when you’re depleted to begin with. But at the same time, a little nighttime play can be a great release right before bed.  
In fact, according to [research](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/having-sex-more-often-can-help-you-sleep-better#Does-having-sex-help-you-sleep-better?), oxytocin, a hormone that’s generally released in the midst of any brand of sensual activity, can be like a sleep wonder drug. It provides relief and catharsis, which may just help lull you to sleep. 

Then, cuddling is a matter of preference. But in most cases, at least at night, you’ve got the _option_.
