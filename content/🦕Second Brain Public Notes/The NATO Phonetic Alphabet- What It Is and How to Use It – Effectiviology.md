## Highlights

> A _phonetic alphabet_ is an alphabet in which each letter is represented by a codeword that starts with that letter. For example, in a phonetic alphabet, the letter ‘B’ could be represented by the word ‘Bravo’, while the letter ‘P’ could be represented by the word ‘Papa’.

> The NATO phonetic alphabet, which uses a standardized set of codewords in order to refer to the letters in the English alphabet, is the most common type of phonetic alphabet in modern use. Phonetic alphabets in general, and the NATO phonetic alphabet in particular, are useful tools, since they can help you communicate more effectively in various situations. Furthermore, because the concept behind them is simple and intuitive, these alphabets can be learned quickly and easily.

> Accordingly, the NATO phonetic alphabet consists of 26 codewords, each of which represents a different letter of the English alphabet. These words are:

> For example, using the NATO phonetic alphabet, you would spell the word ‘positive’ in the following manner:

> ## Tips for using the NATO phonetic alphabet
> 
> There are a few things you should keep in mind when using the NATO alphabet, in order to ensure that you’re using it as effectively as possible:
> 
> * Make sure that the person you’re talking to knows that you are spelling out words using the NATO phonetic alphabet, before you start doing so.
> * If the person that you’re talking to is _not_ familiar with the concept of the phonetic alphabet, you can use the following pattern of speech when spelling out words: “S as in Sierra, N as in November…”, which most people will intuitively understand.
> * In some cases, you might benefit from saying the full term that you’re referencing before you start spelling it using the phonetic alphabet. This can help, for example, in situations where the other person might be able to figure out what you’re trying to spell when you’re halfway through the term.
