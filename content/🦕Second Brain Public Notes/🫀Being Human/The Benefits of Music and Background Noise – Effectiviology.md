> Research shows that listening to music or background noise can lead to various benefits, in situations where you work, study, or perform a similar type of activity. Most notably, music and background noise can lead to the following benefits:
> 
> * **Improved cognitive performance.** For example, listening to music has been shown to improve performance on tests measuring [intelligence](https://doi.org/10.2466%2Fpms.1997.85.3f.1435) and various [cognitive functions](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0305735607068885), and to improve people’s ability to perform [mental arithmetic](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1994.03520110062030). Similarly, listening to background noise has been shown to improve people’s [recognition memory](https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn%5Fa%5F00537), which is the ability to recognize previously encountered objects, entities, and events, as well as their [abstract processing](https://doi.org/10.1086/665048), which is the ability to think about abstract concepts.
> * **Improved task performance.** For example, listening to music has been shown to improve students’ [reading comprehension](https://doi.org/10.2466%2Fpms.1989.69.2.531) and their ability to [learn material](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2011.10.004). Similarly, listening to background noise has been shown to improve people’s performance on [creative tasks](https://doi.org/10.1086/665048).
> * **Improved concentration.** For example, listening to music has been shown to help people maintain concentration when performing repetitive tasks over [long periods of time](https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-6870%2872%2990101-9).
> * **Increased energy levels.** For example, listening to music has been shown to energize people when they deal with [monotonous tasks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2013.09.004).
> * **Improved mood.** For example, listening to music has been shown to improve [people’s mood](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0305735605050650) and increase their [work satisfaction](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090423132615.htm). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-benefits-of-music-and-background-noise-effectiviology-18dff4e8b05#c08314fb-0770-4389-9274-789fd962aaac)  ^c08314fb

> Note that many of these benefits are interrelated. This means, for example, that when music leads to improved mood, that can improve people’s concentration, and consequently also improve their performance on related tasks.
> 
> In addition, music and background noise can lead to additional benefits beyond the domains of work and study. Most notably:
> 
> * **Stress relief.** For example, natural sounds, such as running water and chirping birds, have been shown to help [relieve stress](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph7031036).
> * **Improved social interactions.** For example, having background music during social interactions has been shown to help people feel more comfortable, which can lead them to [communicate better](https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1993.72.1.171) and [enjoy conversations more](https://doi.org/10.2466%2Fpr0.1993.72.1.171).
> * **Improved sport and exercise experience.** For example, listening to music while [playing sports or exercising](http://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000216) has been shown to improve physical performance, reduce perceived exertion, and increase positive emotions.
> * **Improved health.** For example, listening to music has been shown to improve people’s [physical and mental health](https://doi.org/10.3402/qhw.v8i0.20635) in various ways, including by helping [alleviate pain](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F104990919601300211), [reduce feelings of depression](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2004.07.007), and [improve recovery](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2004.01048.x) after [surgery](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2815%2960169-6).
> 
> Finally, certain populations can benefit in unique ways from certain types of music or background noise. For example, some types of white noise have been shown to help people [who have ADHD,](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12993-016-0095-y) by [reducing their ADHD symptoms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2018.11.012) and [improving their cognitive performance](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01749.x).

> Overall, research shows that listening to music and background noise can offer various benefits, including improved cognitive performance, improved task performance, improved concentration, increased energy levels, and improved mood. These benefits mean that listening to music or background noise can be highly beneficial in a variety of circumstances, especially since it is often relatively easy to set them up.
