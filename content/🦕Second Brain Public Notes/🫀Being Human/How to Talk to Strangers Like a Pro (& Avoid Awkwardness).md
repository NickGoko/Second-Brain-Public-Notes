> ## The Three W’s of Talking to Strangers (Why, Where, and When)
> 
> Talking to strangers starts with a mindset shift. It is essential to embrace getting out of your comfort zone and sharing your unique personality with a new person that knows nothing about you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#fefe4fa4-10c0-479f-84e9-5d2e07861884)  ^fefe4fa4

> But there is also a bit of un-learning required to talk to a random person.
> 
> If you’re willing to embrace a little bit of discomfort, the potential rewards of talking to strangers could be huge:
> 
> * Feel a deeper connection to humanity
> * Practice your conversation skills in a low-pressure environment
> * Learn [how to read people](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-read-people/)
> * Understand how people perceive you in different situations
> * Gain a diversity of perspectives
> * Get out of your [comfort zone](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/comfort-zone/)
> * Expand your business network
> * Potential to make new friends or [romantic connections](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/first-date-tips/) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#ecf7788a-2284-48e4-a421-9849a01c5d43)  ^ecf7788a

> Before digging into exactly _how_ to talk to strangers, it helps lay a little groundwork with the Three W’s of Talking to Strangers: why, where, and when to approach someone you don’t know. 
> 
> 1. Why? Figure out why you want to talk to strangers in the first place
> 
> First things first, define your goal for approaching strangers in different settings: 
> 
> * Are you looking for new friendships?
> * Are you practicing your “people skills” or trying to be less shy?
> * Do you want to be more confident at parties and networking events?
> * Are you simply seeking a deeper human connection?
> 
> These are all great reasons to strike up a conversation with someone you don’t know. Your motives will inherently impact the direction you take in each interaction. 
> 
> If you’re looking for friendships or networking opportunities, you may want to make an effort to exchange contact info at the end of the interaction. 
> 
> On the other hand, if you’re practicing people skills or just looking for a way to pass the time in the airport, you’re likely more interested in an intriguing conversation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#2d939003-5e53-4b6e-bf68-bd09070155f4)  ^2d939003

> 1. Where? Go to the right places to talk to strangers
> 
> Statistically, you’re unlikely to have a good conversation with the Amazon delivery guy at your front door. You need to get out in public to seek out people who may be open to chatting actively. 
> 
> Some great places to find strangers to talk to:
> 
> * Coffee shops and cafes
> * Public parks, dog parks (if you have a dog), playgrounds (if you have kids), or recreational areas
> * Beaches, rivers, or lakes
> * Gathering places (picnic tables, pavilions, open spaces)
> * Checkout lines (such as a grocery store, convenience store, or coffee shop)
> * Cafeterias or public eating areas
> * The break room at work or school
> * Concerts
> * Conferences and events
> * Bars and breweries
> * Parties
> * Stores or shopping centers
> * Airports and airplanes
> 
> On the flip side, some locations and scenarios _aren’_t great for talking to strangers, such as locker rooms, quiet spaces like libraries, or offices where people focus on their job.

> 1. When? Use [body language](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/body-language-examples/ "16 Essential Body Language Examples and Their Meanings") to know when to approach a stranger
> 
> Think about a time someone awkward came to you. What made you feel weird about them? Were they hunched over, concealing their eyes, arms crossed, or had a negative vibe to them? Or were they just trying to start a conversation at an awkward place or moment?
> 
> Learning to [decode body language cues](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-read-people/) is a vital skill for any social interaction, but it is essential when you’re approaching strangers. 
> 
> The key signs that someone wants to interact with you may include:
> 
> * Returning your eye contact
> * Smiling at you
> * Open arms or visible hands
> * Appearing relaxed
> * Facing their torso or feet toward you
> * They are not busy with any other task or conversation
> * They openly invite you to sit down
> 
> If someone doesn’t want to talk, they may use these body language cues to let you know:
> 
> * Avoiding eye contact
> * Crossed arms
> * A clenched jaw or tense shoulders
> * Furrowed brows or a frown
> * Tightened neck
> * Headphones in their ears
> * Grabbing their phone or a book to disengage
> * The torso is pointing away from you
> 
> It may not be best to approach a stranger when eating, talking to someone else, or busy with something.
> 
> [Rejection](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/rejection-hurts/ "Why Rejection Hurts So Much And How To Heal The Pain") is part of talking to strangers, and it’s essential not to take it personally. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#5d87d13a-8d80-4d03-a99e-4ee837e4a113)  ^5d87d13a

> ## How to Approach a Stranger (Without Being Awkward)
> 
> Learning to [read body language](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/body-language/) and modify your own is the secret to approaching strangers without looking or feeling like a weirdo. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#2cfae112-a480-49e6-ba04-bff9c314b72e)  ^2cfae112

> Walking up to someone you don’t know can be nerve-wracking, but you can take some simple steps to be friendlier so that you and the other person are more at ease. 
> 
> ### Step 1: Start with eye contact
> 
> Scientific researchers have found that [oxytocin increases with eye contact](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322307006178), creating more trust between two strangers. When you notice someone you may want to talk to, begin by making eye contact with them. 
> 
> But how long do you hold eye contact? Find a balance between darting your eyes (moving your eye contact away too quickly) versus staring for too long (longer than 5 seconds could feel awkward).  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#afda24db-d46c-436c-85e8-026aa81f85a0)  ^afda24db

> **Eye Contact Tip #1**: A casual gaze for 3-5 seconds should suffice for demonstrating your interest. If someone raises their eyebrows, it could signify they are interested in talking to you.
> 
> Prolonged eye contact can make some people feel uncomfortable. If someone shifts their eyes away or avoids your eye contact altogether, this could be the first sign that they don’t want to talk.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#10b67727-0403-4533-8f22-f11eba7d22a2)  ^10b67727

> **Eye Contact Tip #2**: If you wear sunglasses or a hat that conceals your eyes, take them off when you want to meet someone. 
> 
> Back in the old days, a “tip of the hat” was a standard chivalrous greeting to show you’re polite and not trying to hide anything. Revealing your head and face can make you seem more approachable. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#808b71a0-7d2f-435c-b0c9-475656c0849a)  ^808b71a0

> ### Step 2: Smile warmly
> 
> As you prepare to approach a stranger, make sure you smile a warm, genuine smile. 
> 
> But remember, there is an [art to smiling](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/smile/). 
> 
> If you smile too quickly and then fade the expression from your face within a few seconds, you may appear fake or uninterested. Yet if you force a smile with a clenched jaw and tightened cheeks, you could show that you feel awkward or uncomfortable.
> 
> Cues of a comfortable, genuine smile include: 
> 
> * Relaxed lips
> * Face leaning slightly forward
> * A longer onset
> * Raised yet relaxed cheeks
> * Slightly squinted eyes [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#8c1e91e9-5506-46f8-83e0-c25eb723cd3c)  ^8c1e91e9

> **Smiling Tip #1**: If you feel nervous about smiling at a stranger, think of something familiar that brings you joy (maybe your puppy or a funny memory). This will help your smile appear more genuine and welcoming. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#75834007-9559-4eb3-99dc-1cb0c4c7ce6e)  ^75834007

> **Smiling Tip #2**: If a stranger returns your smile, this could be a sign they are open to you approaching them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#73b8bf47-5db9-4611-97a3-7c485575ac35)  ^73b8bf47

> ### Step 3: Show your hands
> 
> Surveys found that people [perceive others as more trustworthy](https://www.businessinsider.com/body-language-tricks-appear-trustworthy-2016-6?r=US&IR=T#-2) when they see their hands. 
> 
> Hiding your hands behind your back, in your pockets, or crossing your arms may give [negative body language cues](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/body-language/) that look defensive or unreceptive. 
> 
> This is why it’s so important to show your hands by keeping them relaxed to your side or reaching out for a [handshake](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/handshake/ "22 Secret Tips to Master The Proper Handshake"). This makes you seem more like a friend than a foe. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#8b0e3897-98b4-434e-b5ae-a0a2976af2d9)  ^8b0e3897

> ## 9 Tips to Start & Hold a Conversation with a Stranger
> 
> Once you’ve read someone’s body language and approached them with the 3 social [cues](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/cues) described above, it’s probably a good sign that you can strike up a conversation. 
> 
> But [starting and holding a dazzling conversation](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/have-hold-conversation/) is as much an art as a science. Use these 9 tips to talk to strangers like a pro. 
> 
> 1. The opening line
> 
> You know that feeling when you finally get the courage to talk to someone but freeze because you don’t know what to say? Yeah… awkward.
> 
> An opening line establishes the tone for the interaction. But contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to say something super profound or rehearse a profoundly intriguing question to start a good conversation.
> 
> Research has shown that people respond best to a simple “hey, how are you?” 
> 
> _How basic_, right? 
> 
> But it works. It’s easy, disarming, and natural. They don’t have to analyze their response, and you both feel a little more at ease. 
> 
> Depending on your personality and the formality of the scenario, you may want to use another version of this simple opener:
> 
> * “Hey, how’s it going?”
> * “What’s up? I’m Logan!”
> * “Hello, how’s your day been?”
> * “Hi, how are you today? I’m Vanessa.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#e7004361-bc5a-4994-bd28-488e2f66fa52)  ^e7004361

> **Action Tip**: Starting a conversation doesn’t have to be super awkward. Memorize a few of these [57 Killer Conversation Starters](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/conversation-starters-topics/) so you always know where to go next. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#296e8cc7-db08-4b3b-914c-c0d2612d47c9)  ^296e8cc7

> 1. Introduce yourself
> 
> Putting a name to your face [builds rapport](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/zoom-etiquette/ "Zoom Etiquette: How to Build Rapport Online Like a Pro") and helps catapult you into more natural conversation. After all, once you know someone’s name, you’re technically no longer strangers.
> 
> If you’re at a party with colleagues or other friends, it usually makes sense to introduce yourself and reach out for a handshake. For example:
> 
> **You**: “Hey, how’s it going? I’m Logan.” (reaches for a handshake)
> 
> **Stranger**: “Hi there, I’m Brian. Nice to meet you.” (returns handshake)
> 
> **You**: “You too! This venue is so nice. Have you been here before?” 
> 
> At this point, you can move on to the triangulation or complement methods described below to dig into a conversation topic and learn about the other person. 
> 
> **Bonus Tip**: Sometimes, it’s hard to figure out when to tell someone your name and ask for theirs. If you’re talking to a random person on the street or striking up a conversation with a stranger in line at the grocery store, you may want to hold off on introducing yourself until you’ve talked for a few minutes. 
> 
> You can say, 
> 
> * “Oh, by the way, what’s your name?”
> * “I didn’t catch your name?”
> * “I’m Logan, by the way; it’s been such a pleasure talking to you.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#edbb7066-b858-45e0-a250-bc9c5b9a4da7)  ^edbb7066

> 1. Use triangulation
> 
> If you don’t know where to take the conversation after introductions, you can use “triangulation” to break the ice. 
> 
> Kio Stark, author of _When Strangers Meet,_ describes this method in her TED Talk [Why You Should Talk to Strangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFpDK2KhAgw&t=312s). The concept is simple. Imagine three metaphorical points of a triangle:
> 
> 1. You
> 2. The stranger you want to talk to
> 3. Something in your immediate surroundings that you can both notice and comment on, such as:
> * The food or drink at the bar
> * The host of an event
> * A mutual acquaintance
> * A nearby building with unique architecture
> * Someone dancing or performing
> * Wildlife (a special bird or insect)
> * Artwork on the street or the walls
> * Group of kids playing in the park
> * Someone with a fantastic outfit
> * A sign or menu item in a cafe
> 
> Science proves that people are more likely to connect when they feel a [sense of shared experience](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12144). Take notice of your surroundings and use them as an instant source of commonality. After all, you both happen to be in the same place simultaneously. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#4973c820-93af-4017-91e1-a40c1bf04ac1)  ^4973c820

> 1. Try a compliment
> 
> Complimenting people is one of the easiest ways to initiate or enhance a conversation.
> 
> You could comment on, 
> 
> * Their shirt or dress
> * Their shoes
> * A unique piece of jewelry
> * Their hairstyle
> * A bag or accessory
> 
> Style and clothing are vital pieces of self-identity that help us portray who we are. At best, a simple compliment on a stranger’s jewelry could lead to getting to know about their family and where they grew up:
> 
> **You**: “I like that necklace. Where did you get it?”
> 
> **Stranger**: “Oh, it was my grandmother’s.”
> 
> **You**: “That’s so nice. What is the charm on it?”
> 
> **Stranger**: “It’s a dove. That was her favorite bird.”
> 
> **You**: “Wow, how special. Did you grow up spending time with her here in Miami?”
> 
> **Stranger**: “Oh no, I’m from New York, and my grandmother grew up in south Texas. I used to visit her there in the summers.” 
> 
> You can see how this conversation trajectory could easily lead to more questions and intriguing topics. 
> 
> But sometimes, a compliment is just a nice comment. At the very least, it can make them feel warm and appreciated.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#c9e07b11-88c6-4088-bff5-867cd7c824b9)  ^c9e07b11

> **Action Step**: Learn to [give genuine compliments](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/fake-compliments/) (and avoid fake ones) with this simple guide. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#9c6b0769-1da6-414a-950a-8c29b1b03aa7)  ^9c6b0769

> 1. Use the Ping Pong Method
> 
> To keep the dialogue flowing, it helps to think of your conversation like a game of Ping Pong: it should be an even amount of back-and-forth. 
> 
> You ask someone questions about themselves to serve the ball into their court. 
> 
> When they answer, they’ll (hopefully) send the ball back into your court, at which point you can expand on what they have to say.
> 
> It looks something like this:
> 
> * You ask a question
> * They answer
> * Talk about their answer
> * You ask another related question to deepen the discussion [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-talk-to-strangers-like-a-pro-avoid-awkwardness-18dda09ddb3#85e49af0-936a-4fec-aa6a-bdd476d02242)  ^85e49af0
