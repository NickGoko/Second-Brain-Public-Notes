## [SCP](#)
SCP stands for "Secure Copy Protocol," and it is a network protocol used for securely transferring files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts. SCP is a command-line tool and part of the SSH (Secure Shell) suite of network protocols, making it a secure and efficient method for transferring files over a network.

Here are some key features and characteristics of SCP:
1. **Security**: SCP ==encrypts both the authentication and data transfer, ensuring that files are transferred securely over potentially untrusted networks.== %% How does the underlying encryption work %%
2. **Authentication**: SCP typically uses SSH for authentication, which includes methods like password-based authentication or key-based authentication, adding an additional layer of security.  
%% Okay now i know SSH is used for encrypting authentication %%
3. **Syntax**: The basic syntax for using SCP is as follows:
   ```
   scp [options] [source] [destination]
   ```
   - `[source]`: The file or directory you want to copy.
   - `[destination]`: The location where you want to copy the source file or directory.

4. **Usage**: SCP can be used to copy files from a local machine to a remote server, from a remote server to a local machine, or between two remote servers.

Here are a couple of common examples of SCP usage:

- Copy a local file to a remote server:
  ```
  scp localfile.txt username@remote_server:/path/to/destination/
  ```
%% feels very much like ssh because it does work with SSH to authenticate the connections so copying can take place. %%  
Copy a file from a remote server to a local machine:
  ```
  scp username@remote_server:/path/to/remotefile.txt /local/destination/
  ```

Overall, SCP is a secure and widely used method for transferring files in a networked environment, particularly in scenarios where data security is a concern.  
%% Okay commonly used method good for where data security is not guaranteed. %%  
%% But how does it do the encryption in transit bit?? %%
## Nslookup
`nslookup` stands for "Name Server Lookup," and it is a command-line tool and network protocol used for querying and obtaining information from Domain Name System (DNS) servers. DNS is a critical system on the internet that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to locate and communicate with each other.[[DNS & the internet 24-10-2023 09.35]]

Here's how `nslookup` works and what it's used for:

1. **Querying DNS Information**: `nslookup` allows you to query DNS servers to retrieve various types of DNS records, including:
   - **A Records**: These records map domain names to IPv4 addresses.
   - **AAAA Records**: These records map domain names to IPv6 addresses.
   - **MX Records**: These records specify mail servers responsible for receiving email for a domain.
   - **CNAME Records**: These records provide canonical names for aliases or domain redirection.

2. **Diagnosing DNS Issues**: Network administrators and users often use `nslookup` to diagnose and troubleshoot DNS-related problems. It can help identify DNS misconfigurations, resolve domain name issues, and check the responsiveness of DNS servers.

3. **Syntax**: The basic syntax of the `nslookup` command is:
   ```
   nslookup [domain] [DNS-server]
   ```
   - `[domain]`: The domain name or IP address you want to look up.
   - `[DNS-server]`: (Optional) The specific DNS server you want to query. If not specified, the system's default DNS server is used.

4. **Interactive Mode**: You can also run `nslookup` in interactive mode by simply typing `nslookup` at the command prompt. In this mode, you can enter multiple queries and receive responses without exiting the program.

5. **Cross-Platform**: `nslookup` is available on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. The specific behavior and options may vary slightly between platforms.

Overall, `nslookup` is a valuable tool for DNS troubleshooting, querying DNS information, and understanding how DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses. It plays a crucial role in managing and maintaining the functionality of the internet's naming system.![[Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 11.39.40.png]]![[Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 11.06.21.png]]

## [Handshake Protocols](#) ^5a2eb7
In computing, a **handshake** is a signal between two devices or programs, used to, e.g., authenticate, coordinate. An example is the handshaking between a [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor "Hypervisor") and an application in a [guest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization "Hardware virtualization") [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine").

In [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication"), a **handshake** is an automated process of negotiation between two participants (example "[Alice and Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob "Alice and Bob")") through the exchange of information that establishes the protocols of a communication link at the start of the communication, before full communication begins.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)#cite_note-1) The handshaking process usually takes place in order to establish rules for communication when a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") attempts to communicate with another device. Signals are usually exchanged between two devices to establish a communication link. For example, when a computer communicates with another device such as a [modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem "Modem"), the two devices will signal each other that they are switched on and ready to work, as well as to agree to which protocols are being used.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)#cite_note-2)

Handshaking can negotiate parameters that are acceptable to equipment and systems at both ends of the communication channel, including [information transfer rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate "Bit rate"), coding [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet"), [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit "Parity bit"), [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt "Interrupt") procedure, and other [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(computing) "Protocol (computing)") or hardware features. Handshaking is a technique of communication between two entities. However, within TCP/IP RFCs, the term "handshake" is most commonly used to reference the TCP three-way handshake. For example, the term "handshake" is not present in RFCs covering FTP or SMTP. One exception is Transport Layer Security, TLS, setup, FTP RFC 4217. In place of the term "handshake", FTP RFC 3659 substitutes the term "conversation" for the passing of commands.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)#cite_note-5)

A simple handshaking protocol might only involve the receiver sending a message meaning "I received your last message and I am ready for you to send me another one." A more complex handshaking protocol might allow the sender to ask the receiver if it is ready to receive or for the receiver to reply with a negative acknowledgement meaning "I did not receive your last message correctly, please resend it" (e.g., if the data was [corrupted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption "Data corruption") en route).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)#cite_note-6)
### [TCP three-way handshake](#)
![](https://i.imgur.com/8Ku0PpZ.png)  
Establishing a normal [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment "Transmission Control Protocol") connection requires three separate steps:
1. The first host (Alice) sends the second host (Bob) a "synchronize" (SYN) message with its own sequence number �![x](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4), which Bob receives.
2. Bob replies with a synchronize-acknowledgment ([SYN-ACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN-ACK "SYN-ACK")) message with its own sequence number �![y](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) and acknowledgement number �+1![x+1](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16df430ed7a23df9b160a5bbd957f306a0c3baa7), which Alice receives.
3. Alice replies with an acknowledgment (ACK) message with acknowledgement number �+1![y+1](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68cb1e544b695b5f0b8f1439a282d74703c8bb05), which Bob receives and to which he doesn't need to reply.

In this setup, the synchronize messages act as service requests from one server to the other, while the acknowledgement messages return to the requesting server to let it know the message was received.

The reason for the client and server not using a default sequence number such as 0 for establishing the connection is to protect against two incarnations of the same connection reusing the same sequence number too soon, which means a segment from an earlier incarnation of a connection might interfere with a later incarnation of the connection.

## Application Layer
![](https://i.imgur.com/OnQ1X7h.png)  
![](https://i.imgur.com/wI9sRb5.png)

### HTTP
The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) is an [application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer "Application layer") protocol in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite") model for distributed, collaborative, [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia "Hypermedia") information systems.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#cite_note-rfc9110-1) HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"), where [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext "Hypertext") documents include [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink") to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse "Computer mouse") click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.  
**HTTP/3** is the third major version of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") used to exchange information on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"), complementing the widely-deployed [HTTP/1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/1.1 "HTTP/1.1") and [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2 "HTTP/2"). Unlike previous versions which relied on the well-established [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (published in 1974),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3#cite_note-2) HTTP/3 uses [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC "QUIC"), a [multiplexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing "Multiplexing") transport protocol built on [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3#cite_note-3) On 6 June 2022, IETF published HTTP/3 as a [Proposed Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_Standard "Proposed Standard") in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [9114](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3#cite_note-4)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/HTTP-1.1_vs._HTTP-2_vs._HTTP-3_Protocol_Stack.svg/336px-HTTP-1.1_vs._HTTP-2_vs._HTTP-3_Protocol_Stack.svg.png)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HTTP-1.1_vs._HTTP-2_vs._HTTP-3_Protocol_Stack.svg)

Protocol Stack of HTTP/3 compared to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

HTTP/3 uses similar semantics compared to earlier revisions of the protocol, including the same [request methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods "Hypertext Transfer Protocol"), [status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Response_status_codes "Hypertext Transfer Protocol"), and [message fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields "List of HTTP header fields"), but encodes them and maintains session state differently. However, partially due to the protocol's adoption of QUIC, HTTP/3 has lower latency and loads more quickly in real-world usage when compared with previous versions: in some cases over 3× faster than with HTTP/1.1 (which, for many websites, is the only HTTP version deployed) HTTP/3 is (at least partially) supported by 94% of tracked web browser installations (96% of "tracked mobile" and 94% of "tracked desktop" web browsers), and 26% of the top 10 million websites.  
 It has been supported by [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser) "Chromium (web browser)") (and derived projects including [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome"), [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge "Microsoft Edge"), [Samsung Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Internet "Samsung Internet"), and [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser) "Opera (web browser)"))since April 2020 and by [Mozilla Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox "Mozilla Firefox") since May 2021. Safari 14 implemented the protocol but it remains [disabled by default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle "Feature toggle").

### DNS
The **Domain Name System** (**DNS**) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), services, and other resources in the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") or other [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) networks.  
It associates various information with _[domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name "Domain name")_ (identification [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)")) assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying [network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol "Network protocol").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#cite_note-1) The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating [authoritative name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritative_name_server "Authoritative name server") for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over [sub-domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-domain "Sub-domain") of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and [fault-tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault-tolerant "Fault-tolerant") service and was designed to avoid a single large central database. In addition, the DNS specifies the technical functionality of the [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model "Database model") service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite").

The Internet maintains two principal [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace "Namespace"), the domain name hierarchy and the IP [address spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#cite_note-rfc781-2) The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet [name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server "Name server") and a [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for start of authority ([SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOA_record "SOA record")), IP addresses ([A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A "List of DNS record types") and [AAAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA_record "AAAA record")), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP "SMTP") [mail exchangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_exchanger "Mail exchanger") (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for [reverse DNS lookups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup "Reverse DNS lookup") (PTR), and [domain name aliases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_alias "Domain name alias") (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC "DNSSEC") records, or for human queries such as _responsible person_ (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating [unsolicited email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolicited_email "Unsolicited email") (spam) by storing a [real-time blackhole list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_blackhole_list "Real-time blackhole list") (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the [zone file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file "Zone file"), but other database systems are common.

The Domain Name System originally used the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP) as transport over IP. Reliability, security, and privacy concerns spawned the use of the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP) as well as numerous other protocol developments.
### FTP
The **File Transfer Protocol** (**FTP**) is a standard [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") used for the transfer of [computer files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file") from a server to a client on a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). FTP is built on a [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-for-1) FTP users may authenticate themselves with a [plain-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often [secured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#Security) with [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") ([FTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTPS "FTPS")) or replaced with [SSH File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol "SSH File Transfer Protocol") (SFTP).

The first FTP client applications were [command-line programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") developed before [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") had [graphical user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface"), and are still shipped with most [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows"), [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix"), and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") operating systems.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-tcpip-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-net+-3) Many dedicated FTP [clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing) "Client (computing)") and automation utilities have since been developed for [desktops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer "Desktop computer"), servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications such as [HTML editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_editor "HTML editor") and [file managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_managers "File managers").

An FTP client used to be commonly integrated in [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"), where file servers are browsed with the [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier "Uniform Resource Identifier") prefix "`ftp://`". In 2021, FTP support was dropped by Google Chrome and Firefox,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-:0-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-chromestatus-5) two major web browser vendors, due to it being superseded by the more secure SFTP and FTPS; although neither of them have implemented the newer protocols.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#cite_note-7)
### HTTPS
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure** (**HTTPS**) is an extension of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") (HTTP). It uses [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") for [secure communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communications "Secure communications") over a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), and is widely used on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-2) In HTTPS, the [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") is encrypted using [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as **HTTP over TLS**,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-3) or **HTTP over SSL**.

The principal motivations for HTTPS are [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") of the accessed [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") and protection of the [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy "Information privacy") and [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity") of the exchanged data while it is in transit. It protects against [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack "Man-in-the-middle attack"), and the bidirectional [block cipher encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation "Block cipher mode of operation") of communications between a client and server protects the communications against [eavesdropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping "Eavesdropping") and [tampering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamper-evident#Tampering "Tamper-evident").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-httpse-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-5) The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate "Public key certificate"). This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"). In 2016, a campaign by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation") with the support of [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-6) HTTPS is now used more often by web users than the original, non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites, secure accounts, and keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.
### IMAP
![](https://i.imgur.com/PG3f5NE.png)

### IRC
![](https://i.imgur.com/F6y5vQg.png)

### SIP
The **Session Initiation Protocol** (**SIP**) is a [signaling protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_protocol "Signaling protocol") used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating [communication sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_session "Communication session") that include voice, video and messaging applications.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-What_is_SIP?-1) SIP is used in [Internet telephony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_telephony "Internet telephony"), in private IP telephone systems, as well as mobile phone calling over [LTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication) "LTE (telecommunication)") ([VoLTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoLTE "VoLTE")).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-2)

The protocol defines the specific format of messages exchanged and the sequence of communications for cooperation of the participants. SIP is a [text-based protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_protocol "Text-based protocol"), incorporating many elements of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") (HTTP) and the [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol") (SMTP).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol#cite_note-Johnston-3) A call established with SIP may consist of multiple [media streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media"), but no separate streams are required for applications, such as [text messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging "Text messaging"), that exchange data as payload in the SIP message.

SIP works in conjunction with several other protocols that specify and carry the session media. Most commonly, media type and parameter negotiation and media setup are performed with the [Session Description Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol "Session Description Protocol") (SDP), which is carried as payload in SIP messages. SIP is designed to be independent of the underlying [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer") protocol and can be used with the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP), the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP), and the [Stream Control Transmission Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol "Stream Control Transmission Protocol") (SCTP). For secure transmissions of SIP messages over insecure network links, the protocol may be encrypted with [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") (TLS). For the transmission of media streams (voice, video) the SDP payload carried in SIP messages typically employs the [Real-time Transport Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol "Real-time Transport Protocol") (RTP) or the [Secure Real-time Transport Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol "Secure Real-time Transport Protocol") (SRTP).

### SMTP
The **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol** (**SMTP**) is an [Internet standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard "Internet Standard") [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") for [electronic mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email") transmission. Mail servers and other [message transfer agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent "Message transfer agent") use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level [email clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client "Email client") typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [8314](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8314). For retrieving messages, [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol "Internet Message Access Protocol") (which replaced the older [POP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol "Post Office Protocol")) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols, e.g., [Exchange ActiveSync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_ActiveSync "Exchange ActiveSync").

SMTP's origins began in 1980, building on concepts implemented on the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET "ARPANET") since 1971. It has been updated, modified and extended multiple times. The protocol version in common use today has extensible structure with various extensions for [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authentication "SMTP Authentication"), [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_encryption "Email encryption"), binary data transfer, and [internationalized email addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_email "International email"). SMTP servers commonly use the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") on [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number "Port number") 25 (for plaintext) and 587 (for encrypted communications).

### SSH
The **Secure Shell Protocol** (**SSH**) is a [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") [network protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol "Network protocol") for operating [network services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service "Network service") securely over an unsecured network.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#cite_note-rfc4251-1) Its most notable applications are remote [login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login "Login") and [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") execution.

SSH applications are based on a [client–server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") architecture, connecting an [SSH client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_client "SSH client") instance with an [SSH server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_server "SSH server").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#cite_note-rfc4252-2) SSH operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical components: the _transport layer_ provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity; the _user authentication protocol_ validates the user to the server; and the _connection protocol_ multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#cite_note-rfc4251-1)

SSH was designed on [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") operating systems, as a replacement for [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet "Telnet") and for [unsecured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") remote [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") protocols, such as the Berkeley [Remote Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Shell "Remote Shell") (rsh) and the related [rlogin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rlogin "Rlogin") and [rexec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Process_Execution "Remote Process Execution") protocols, which all use insecure, [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") transmission of authentication tokens.

SSH was first designed in 1995 by Finnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen. Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is [OpenSSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH "OpenSSH"), released in 1999 as open-source software by the [OpenBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD "OpenBSD") developers. Implementations are distributed for all types of operating systems in common use, including embedded systems.
### Telnet
Telnet, short for "teletype network," is a network protocol and a command-line tool that allows remote terminal access to a device or a computer over a network. It was widely used in the past for remote administration and accessing remote systems, but its use has declined in favor of more secure protocols like SSH (Secure Shell). Here's an explanation of Telnet:

1. **Protocol**: Telnet is both a protocol and a program. As a protocol, it defines the rules and standards for establishing and maintaining remote terminal connections over a network. Telnet operates on port 23 by default.

2. **Client-Server Model**: Telnet follows a client-server model. The Telnet client initiates a connection to a Telnet server. The client sends commands and receives responses from the server, effectively allowing the user to interact with the remote system's command line.

3. **Unencrypted**: One of the significant drawbacks of Telnet is that it sends data, including usernames and passwords, in plain text over the network. This lack of encryption makes Telnet insecure for use over untrusted or public networks. Anyone with access to network traffic can potentially intercept sensitive information.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - **Legacy Systems**: Telnet was commonly used in the past for remote administration of devices and systems, especially before more secure alternatives like SSH became prevalent.
   - **Network Troubleshooting**: It can still be used for basic network troubleshooting, such as checking if a network service is running on a remote server or testing network connectivity.

5. **Replacement with SSH**: Due to its security vulnerabilities, Telnet has largely been replaced by SSH (Secure Shell) for secure remote access. SSH provides strong encryption and authentication, making it a safer choice for remote administration and data transfer.

In summary, Telnet is a protocol and a command-line tool used for remote terminal access to devices and computers over a network. However, its use has diminished due to security concerns, and SSH is the recommended choice for secure remote access and administration.  
**Telnet** (short for "teletype network")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:1-2) is a [client/server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") [application protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer "Application layer") that provides access to virtual [terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal "Computer terminal") of [remote systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_system "Remote system") on [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") or the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:2-3) Telnet consists of two components: (1) the protocol itself which specifies how two parties are to communicate and (2) the software application that provides the service. User data is interspersed [in-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-band_signaling "In-band signaling") with Telnet control information in an 8-bit [byte oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_oriented "Byte oriented") data connection over the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [15](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc15), extended in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [855](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc855), and standardized as [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF) Internet Standard [STD 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STD_8 "STD 8"), one of the first Internet standards.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:1-2) Telnet transmits all information including usernames and passwords in plaintext so it is not recommended for security-sensitive applications such as [remote management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_monitoring_and_management "Remote monitoring and management") of routers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:2-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:3-4) Telnet's use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-5) Some extensions to Telnet which would provide encryption have been proposed.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#cite_note-:7-6)
### TLS/SSL

^7c7d77

**Transport Layer Security** (**TLS**) is a [cryptographic protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol "Cryptographic protocol") designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") is widely used in applications such as [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email"), [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging "Instant messaging"), and [voice over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP "Voice over IP"), but its use in securing [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS "HTTPS") remains the most publicly visible.

The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide security, including [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy "Privacy") (confidentiality), integrity, and authenticity through the use of [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), such as the use of [certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate "Public key certificate"), between two or more communicating computer applications. It runs in the [presentation layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer "Presentation layer") and is itself composed of two layers: the TLS record and the TLS [handshake protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing) "Handshake (computing)").

The closely related **Datagram Transport Layer Security** (**DTLS**) is a [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") that provides [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_security "Communications security") to [datagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram "Datagram")-based applications. In technical writing, references to "(**D**)**TLS**" are often seen when it applies to both versions.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#cite_note-1)

TLS is a proposed [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF) standard, first defined in 1999, and the current version is TLS 1.3, defined in August 2018. TLS builds on the now-deprecated **SSL** (**Secure Sockets Layer**) specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by [Netscape Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communications "Netscape Communications") for adding the HTTPS protocol to their [Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator "Netscape Navigator") web browser.
## Transport Layer
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

1. **Connection-Oriented:** TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning it establishes a connection between two devices before data transfer begins. This connection is maintained throughout the communication session.

2. **Reliability:** TCP is highly reliable. It ensures that data sent from one end is received in the correct order and without errors at the other end. If any data packets are lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP will retransmit them.

3. **Flow Control:** TCP includes mechanisms for flow control. This prevents one device from overwhelming the other with data. It uses techniques like windowing to manage data transfer rates.

4. **Ordered Delivery:** TCP guarantees the ordered delivery of data. If you send data packets A, B, and C in that order, they will be received in the same order (A, B, C) by the recipient.

5. **Acknowledgments:** TCP uses acknowledgments to confirm the successful receipt of data packets. If the sender doesn't receive an acknowledgment within a specified time, it will retransmit the data.

6. **Applications:** TCP is commonly used for applications that require high reliability, such as web browsing, email, file transfer (FTP), and remote administration (SSH).
### UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

![[Pasted image 20240229211735.png]]
1. **Connectionless:** UDP is a connectionless protocol. It does not establish a connection before sending data. Each UDP packet (datagram) is sent independently, and there is no ongoing connection maintenance.

2. **Less Reliable:** UDP is less reliable than TCP. It does not guarantee the ordered delivery of data, and there is no error-checking or retransmission of lost packets. If data is lost in transit, it's not retransmitted.

3. **Low Overhead:** UDP has lower overhead compared to TCP because it lacks the complexity of establishing and maintaining connections and managing reliability. This makes it faster and more suitable for real-time applications.

4. **No Flow Control:** UDP has no built-in flow control mechanisms. Applications using UDP must manage data rates and congestion control independently.

5. **Applications:** UDP is used in applications where speed and low latency are more critical than data reliability. Examples include real-time video streaming, online gaming, voice-over-IP (VoIP), and DNS.

In summary, TCP is suited for applications that require reliable, ordered, and error-checked data delivery, even if it comes at the cost of increased latency and overhead. UDP, on the other hand, is used when low latency and fast data transmission are essential, and data reliability can be managed at the application level. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of applications and use cases.


## Internet Layer

### IP( V4 . v6)
The **Internet Protocol** (**IP**) is the [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer "Network layer") [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite") for relaying [datagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram "Datagram") across network boundaries. Its [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing "Routing") function enables [internetworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking "Internetworking"), and essentially establishes the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

IP has the task of delivering [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_(information_technology) "Packet (information technology)") from the source [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network) "Host (network)") to the destination host solely based on the [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") in the packet [headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing) "Header (computing)"). For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that [encapsulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking) "Encapsulation (networking)") the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.

IP was the [connectionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication "Connectionless communication") datagram service in the original [Transmission Control Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Program "Transmission Control Program") introduced by [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf "Vint Cerf") and [Bob Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn "Bob Kahn") in 1974, which was complemented by a [connection-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication "Connection-oriented communication") service that became the basis for the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as _TCP/IP_.

The first major version of IP, [Internet Protocol version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4") (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is [Internet Protocol version 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 "IPv6") (IPv6), which has been in increasing [deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment "IPv6 deployment") on the public Internet since around 2006.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol#cite_note-1)
#### V4
**Internet Protocol version 4** (**IPv4**) is the fourth version of the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based [internetworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking "Internetworking") methods in the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") and other [packet-switched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched "Packet-switched") networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production on [SATNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATNET "SATNET") in 1982 and on the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET "ARPANET") in January 1983. It is still used to route most [Internet traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic "Internet traffic") today,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4#cite_note-:0-1) even with the ongoing deployment of [Internet Protocol version 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 "IPv6") (IPv6),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4#cite_note-2) its successor.

IPv4 uses a [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit "32-bit") address space which provides 4,294,967,296 (232) unique addresses, but large blocks are reserved for special networking purposes.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4#cite_note-rfc6890-4)
#### V6
**Internet Protocol version 6** (**IPv6**) is the most recent version of the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP), the [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). IPv6 was developed by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of [IPv4 address exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion "IPv4 address exhaustion"), and was intended to replace [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-ipv6nz-1) In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc2460-2) which subsequently ratified it as an [Internet Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard "Internet Standard") on 14 July 2017.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc8200-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-4)

Devices on the Internet are assigned a unique [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the IETF had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses 128-[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") addresses, theoretically allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4×1038 total addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special usage or completely excluded from general use. The two protocols are not designed to be [interoperable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperable "Interoperable"), and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several [transition mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_transition_mechanism "IPv6 transition mechanism") have been devised to rectify this.

IPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [route aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_aggregation "Route aggregation") across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [routing tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table "Routing table"). The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.

IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") digits each, separated by colons. The full representation may be shortened; for example, _2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334_ becomes _2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334_.
### ICMP
The **Internet Control Message Protocol** (**ICMP**) is a supporting [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite"). It is used by [network devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_device "Network device"), including [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)"), to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address"), for example, an error is indicated when a requested service is not available or that a [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network) "Host (network)") or router could not be reached.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol#cite_note-Forouzan-2) ICMP differs from [transport protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_protocol "Transport protocol") such as [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility) "Ping (networking utility)") and [traceroute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute "Traceroute")).  
**Internet Control Message Protocol version 6** (**ICMPv6**) is the implementation of the [Internet Control Message Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol "Internet Control Message Protocol") (ICMP) for [Internet Protocol version 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_6 "Internet Protocol version 6") (IPv6).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMPv6#cite_note-rfc4443-1) ICMPv6 is an integral part of IPv6 and performs error reporting and diagnostic functions.

ICMPv6 has a framework for extensions to implement new features. Several extensions have been published, defining new ICMPv6 message types as well as new options for existing ICMPv6 message types. For example, [Neighbor Discovery Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol "Neighbor Discovery Protocol") (NDP) is a node discovery protocol based on ICMPv6 which replaces and enhances functions of [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol "Address Resolution Protocol").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMPv6#cite_note-) [Secure Neighbor Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Neighbor_Discovery "Secure Neighbor Discovery") (SEND) is an extension of NDP with extra security. [Multicast Listener Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_Listener_Discovery "Multicast Listener Discovery") (MLD) is used by IPv6 routers for discovering [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast "Multicast") listeners on a directly attached link, much like [Internet Group Management Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol "Internet Group Management Protocol") (IGMP) is used in [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4"). [Multicast Router Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_Router_Discovery "Multicast Router Discovery") (MRD) allows the discovery of multicast routers.
## Link Layer
In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), the **link layer** is the lowest [layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer") in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite"), the networking architecture of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). The link layer is the group of methods and [communications protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") confined to the link that a host is physically connected to. The link is the physical and logical network component used to interconnect [hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network) "Host (network)") or [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)") in the network and a **link protocol** is a suite of methods and standards that operate only between adjacent network nodes of a [network segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment "Network segment").

Despite the different semantics of layering between the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite") and [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model"), the link layer is sometimes described as a combination of the OSI's [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer") (layer 2) and [physical layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer "Physical layer") (layer 1).

The link layer is described in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [1122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1122) and [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123). RFC 1122 considers local area network protocols such as [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") and other [IEEE 802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802 "IEEE 802") networks (e.g. [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi")), and framing protocols such as [Point-to-Point Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol "Point-to-Point Protocol") (PPP) to belong to the link layer.

### ARP
The **Address Resolution Protocol** (**ARP**) is a [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") used for discovering the [link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer "Link layer") address, such as a [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address "MAC address"), associated with a given [internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer "Internet layer") address, typically an [IPv4 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address "IPv4 address"). This mapping is a critical function in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite"). ARP was defined in 1982 by [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [826](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc826),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol#cite_note-1) which is [Internet Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard "Internet Standard") STD 37.

ARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4"), [Chaosnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaosnet "Chaosnet"), [DECnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECnet "DECnet") and Xerox [PARC Universal Packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_Universal_Packet "PARC Universal Packet") (PUP) using [IEEE 802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802 "IEEE 802") standards, [FDDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDDI "FDDI"), [X.25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25 "X.25"), [Frame Relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_Relay "Frame Relay") and [Asynchronous Transfer Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode "Asynchronous Transfer Mode") (ATM).

In [Internet Protocol Version 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 "IPv6") (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the [Neighbor Discovery Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol "Neighbor Discovery Protocol") (NDP).

### Tunnels
In [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), a **tunneling protocol** is a [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") which allows for the movement of data from one network to another. It involves allowing [private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network "Private network") communications to be sent across a public network (such as the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet")) through a process called [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking) "Encapsulation (networking)").

Because tunneling involves repackaging the traffic data into a different form, perhaps with [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") as standard, it can hide the nature of the traffic that is run through a tunnel.

The tunneling protocol works by using the data portion of a [packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet "Network packet") (the [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing) "Payload (computing)")) to carry the packets that actually provide the service. Tunneling uses a layered protocol model such as those of the [OSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection "Open Systems Interconnection") or [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP "TCP/IP") protocol suite, but usually violates the layering when using the payload to carry a service not normally provided by the network. Typically, the delivery protocol operates at an equal or higher level in the layered model than the payload protocol.
### PPP
In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), **Point-to-Point Protocol** (**PPP**) is a [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer") (layer 2) [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") between two routers directly without any host or any other networking in between. It can provide loop detection [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), transmission [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol#cite_note-1) and [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression "Data compression").

PPP is used over many types of physical networks, including [serial cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_cable "Serial cable"), [phone line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_line "Phone line"), [trunk line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking#Trunk_line "Trunking"), [cellular telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_telephone "Cellular telephone"), specialized radio links, [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN "ISDN"), and [fiber optic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication "Fiber-optic communication") such as [SONET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SONET "SONET"). Since IP packets cannot be transmitted over a [modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem "Modem") line on their own without some data link protocol that can identify where the transmitted frame starts and where it ends, [Internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider "Internet service provider") (ISPs) have used PPP for customer [dial-up access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_access "Dial-up access") to the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

Two derivatives of PPP, [Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet "Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet") (PPPoE) and [Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_ATM "Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM") (PPPoA), are used most commonly by ISPs to establish a [digital subscriber line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line "Digital subscriber line") (DSL) Internet service LP connection with customers.
### MAC
In [IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802 "IEEE 802"), the **medium access control** (**MAC**), also called **media access control**, is the layer that controls the hardware responsible for interaction with the [wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_communication "Wired communication") (electrical or optical) or wireless [transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium "Transmission medium"). The MAC sublayer and the [logical link control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_link_control "Logical link control") (LLC) sublayer together make up the [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer"). The LLC provides [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data) "Flow control (data)") and [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing "Multiplexing") for the logical link (i.e. [EtherType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherType "EtherType"), [802.1Q VLAN tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.1Q_VLAN_tag "802.1Q VLAN tag") etc), while the MAC provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium.

These two sublayers together correspond to layer 2 of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model"). For compatibility reasons, LLC is optional for implementations of [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3 "IEEE 802.3") (the frames are then "raw"), but compulsory for implementations of other IEEE 802 physical layer standards. Within the hierarchy of the OSI model and IEEE 802 standards, the MAC sublayer provides a [control abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_abstraction "Control abstraction") of the physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC sublayer (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the medium access control block is formally connected to the [PHY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHY "PHY") via a [media-independent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media-independent_interface "Media-independent interface"). Although the MAC block is today typically integrated with the PHY within [the same device package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_in_package "System in package"), historically any MAC could be used with any PHY, independent of the transmission medium.

When sending data to another device on the network, the MAC sublayer encapsulates higher-level frames into frames appropriate for the transmission medium (i.e. the MAC adds a [syncword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncword "Syncword") preamble and also padding if necessary), adds a [frame check sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence "Frame check sequence") to identify transmission errors, and then forwards the data to the physical layer as soon as the appropriate [channel access method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_access_method "Channel access method") permits it. For topologies with a [collision domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_domain "Collision domain") (bus, ring, mesh, point-to-multipoint topologies), controlling when data is sent and when to wait is necessary to avoid [collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(telecommunications) "Collision (telecommunications)"). Additionally, the MAC is also responsible for compensating for collisions by initiating retransmission if a [jam signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_signal "Jam signal") is detected. When receiving data from the physical layer, the MAC block ensures data integrity by verifying the sender's frame check sequences, and strips off the sender's preamble and padding before passing the data up to the higher layers.

Functions performed in the MAC sublayer[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medium_access_control&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Functions performed in the MAC sublayer")]

According to IEEE Std 802-2001 section 6.2.3 "MAC sublayer", the primary functions performed by the MAC layer are:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_access_control#cite_note-2)

- Frame delimiting and recognition
- Addressing of destination stations (both as individual stations and as groups of stations)
- Conveyance of source-station addressing information
- Transparent data transfer of LLC PDUs, or of equivalent information in the Ethernet sublayer
- Protection against errors, generally by means of generating and checking frame check sequences
- Control of access to the physical transmission medium

In the case of [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), the functions required of a MAC are:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_access_control#cite_note-3)

- receive/transmit normal frames
- half-duplex retransmission and backoff functions
- append/check FCS ([frame check sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_check_sequence "Frame check sequence"))
- interframe gap enforcement
- discard malformed frames
- prepend(tx)/remove(rx) preamble, SFD ([start frame delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_frame_delimiter "Start frame delimiter")), and padding
- half-duplex compatibility: append(tx)/remove(rx) MAC address
