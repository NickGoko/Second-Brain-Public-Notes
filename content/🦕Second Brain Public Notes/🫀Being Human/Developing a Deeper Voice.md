- Deepen your inner voice
- Embody someone with a deep voice.  
	  Speaking or forcing to speaking in a lower pitch does a number on your vocal cords putting wear and tear. And make you hard to understand.
- Strengthen you **neck muscles** by doing neck crunches everyday. 
- **Read book out loud** at least one page until you find the nice voice tone you are looking for. You have to practice the tone enough times before you try it out people. 
- Having a monotone voicehaving a voice that varies less was found to be more attractive.  
	  How do you have a monotone voice - you need to add more pauses as you speak. 
	
- Breath out as you speak/ Speak on your out breath -Aspirating.  
	  It almost like you are sighing as you are speaking. 
	  
- Drink water - dehydration leads to smaller vocal cords which makes you voice high pitch.  
	  Try make sure the water is lukewarm because cold water will constrict you vocal cords.  
	  Or eat more fruit to hydrate. 

- Speaking from your **mask** - find your natural pitch and optimal tone by projecting from your mask.  
>[!thumbs-down] _Most men are speaking from there lower throat_ to get a deep voice.
