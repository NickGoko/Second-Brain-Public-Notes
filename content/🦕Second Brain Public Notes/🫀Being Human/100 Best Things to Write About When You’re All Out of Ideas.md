Writing can be one of life’s most fulfilling and satisfying experiences. But what can you do when you hit a creative block or are unsure what your writing voice is? Every writer will tell you just get writing. We have fifty-five writing ideas _plus_ writing prompts, so you can discover your amazing writing potential just waiting to be expressed. 

## 100 Writing Ideas When You Don’t Know What to Write

These ideas are organized by theme and topic for easy reference whenever you’re unsure what to write. Don’t forget to print or bookmark this article so you can refer to it when needed. 

### Personal Experiences And Anecdotes

In Anne Lammott’s classic book on writing, _Bird by Bird,_ she encourages writers to start by writing their personal experiences. 

> “You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories.”
> 
> **––Anne Lamott, Author**

These are eight ideas to help you write about your personal experiences. 

1. **Your Life and Memories**

Even if you don’t think your life is interesting, it’s still a treasure trove of source material and inspiration! Start with your earliest memory or something that seems mundane but holds a special place in your heart. Get as detailed as possible.

- What were you feeling?
- Add sight, smell, taste, and texture.
- Describe the people and environment. 
- Connect your memory from the past to something in the present. 
- Try to communicate a mood or your feelings without directly telling us the mood or feeling. 

1. **Interests & Hobbies**

People love to learn new things, and if you have personal experience or knowledge about a topic, you’re the perfect person to write about it. You don’t have to have a Ph.D. in British literature to write about Jane Austen, and you certainly don’t need to be an expert on everything about relationships to write about dating.

Your personal experiences give you a unique view of the subject. Instead of trying to write as an expert (unless you are!), write from your unique angle. 

Maybe you crochet because you live with a chronic illness and need something you can do from bed. Or maybe you’re obsessed with trains because a train engine is easier to understand than interpersonal relationships. 

When writing about interests and hobbies, start with _why_ you love this thing. The rest will follow. 

1. **Experiences From the Every Day**

You may think writing about experiences means going on dramatic global adventures or doing daring and shocking things in daily life. Skip the drama and intrigue––some of the most interesting writing is about mundane things.  

What do you do every day? Write about it. For example, 5% of the American workforce<sup id="footnote-sup-1"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/things-to-write-about/#footnote-1">1</a></sup> takes public transport daily. What does that feel like? Do you have to wake up an hour earlier to get to work on time? Do you worry about your safety? Does public transportation give you freedom, or does it limit what you can do?

5% of Americans will identify with your experiences. For the rest of the population, your writing could offer insight and understanding of an experience far from their own. 

Maybe you’ve lived in Hong Kong and New York. The public transportation between these two places is incredibly different. Or maybe you live in India, where public transport<sup id="footnote-sup-2"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/things-to-write-about/#footnote-2">2</a></sup> has been an ongoing concern for years. Write about that. 

**Pro Tip:** Write about how experiences vary by time, location, and even for different people. 

1. **Feelings and Emotions**

How are you feeling today? Get into the practice of [reflecting on your feelings and emotions](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/emotion-wheel/), either at the start or the end of the day. You’ll build emotional intelligence through self-awareness as you write down your feelings. 

Being connected to your emotions is vital to the writing process. It facilitates writing from multiple perspectives and understanding what motivates people. Whether you’re writing a blog for a specific audience or the next great novel, you’ll need that. 

**Short List of Feelings and Emotions:**

- Certain
- Secure
- Ambitious
- Confident
- Bold
- Pleased
- Grateful
- Optimistic
- Content
- Annoyed
- Critical
- Resentful
- Sad
- Defeated
- Disappointed
- Determined
- Inspired
- Creative
- Hopeful

1. **Thoughts and Ponderings**

Do you ever wonder why mockingbirds sing or feel like the blossoming of cherry trees is a symbol of beauty and regeneration? Whatever you think about, even the most random passing thought can be the foundation for beautiful writing.

**Pro Tip:** Carry paper and pencil with you, or use your notes app on your phone to quickly record your thoughts as they come. Those short notes you made on the commute to work or at night when you can’t sleep may be the seed for something longer. When you aren’t sure what to write about, look over those notes and think about whether you could write an article, a poem, or if it’s even a plot premise for a new book. 

![Meme from Minions Movie about having no ideas when it comes to things to write about ](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/unnamed-29.jpg)

1. **Dreams Without Pressure**

Keep a notebook by your bed and write down your dreams as soon as you wake up. Don’t rely on doing it later because, as we all know, dreams often dissolve from memory if they aren’t recorded immediately.

As well as being a good practice for processing your unconscious thoughts, it gets you into the practice of writing without the pressure of anyone seeing what you’ve written. 

1. **Goals Through the Year**

We’re a big advocate of [setting goals](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/professional-development-goals/) at the start of the year! But you can also write down your goals and aspirations throughout the year. 

Write down your goals and the steps you’ll need to get there, and don’t forget to add specific goals to your writing. This could include a weekly word count, submitting your writing at least once a month, joining a writer’s group, completing your novel by the end of the year, etc.

## How To Set Better Goals Using Science

Do you set the same goals over and over again? If you’re not achieving your goals – it’s not your fault!

Let me show you the science-based goal-setting framework to help you achieve your biggest goals.

1. **Quirky and Strange Family**

Whether it’s your family history or the quirky and strange personalities that make up your family unit, writing about your family can offer insight into who you are. Try taking a step back as you write to observe your family members with less emotion and judgment.

Be curious, and explore what makes your family special, surprising, or intriguing. Even if you don’t have a good relationship with family members, look for things you can appreciate our respect as you write about them.

**Pro Tip:** Ask questions! We often think we know everything about our family, but there are probably experiences and events you’ve never heard about. 

### Current Events And News Stories

When writing about current events, it’s important to be informed before you write and respectful of the people you’re reporting on. Don’t be afraid to be controversial, but don’t seek controversy just for the sake of it. 

As you approach any news story, differentiate between opinion and report. Even if you have a personal perspective, your feelings shouldn’t be included in a news report. That’s what opinion pieces are for.

Let’s dive into five different ways to cover the news. 

1. **Local Perspective on Local Events**

If you want to report on local events, get involved in your community. Make connections with key people, and always be on the lookout for stories. Even if you’re not writing for a publication, you can write about local events to get experience writing and sharpen your observation skills. 

**Action Steps:** Attend a festival or other event and see if you can identify the person in charge. Tell them you’re writing an article about the event and ask if you can have five minutes of their time. If they say no, thank them for their time, leaving them with a good impression of you. They may prove to be a contact for you later! 

Interview at least three people attending the event and practice taking good pictures. If you submit your story to a local paper, they will want photos. 

**Pro Tip:** Research the event, performer, or location and prepare some interesting interview questions in advance. When you ask questions, get permission to record them using a voice memo app on your phone. Have paper and pencil so you can jot down some quick notes as well. 

1. **Global events from a Local Perspective**

Global events offer a constant source for writing topics. Even if you can’t write knowledgeably about foreign relations, you may be able to offer a local perspective on a global concern. Subscribe to a [good news round-up](https://join1440.com/), preferably nonpartisan, to get a daily overview of what’s happening. Plus, check several different partisan news sources to get an idea of the difference in reports. 

1. **Opinion Pieces On Social Or Political Issues**

If you’ve been tracking local and global news for a while, you’ll start forming educated opinions. Not to be confused with what people write on social media every day. If you’re going to write opinion pieces, start developing a robust research process that integrates both the present and an understanding of the past. 

**Action Step:** Pick a social or political issue to start researching. Think critically about the present and ask questions. For example, instead of looking at the labor strikes in England based only on the present, consider the context of British history. Research the first labor strike (The General Strike of 1926) and explore the various responses to and interactions with labor workers by the Conservative and Labor parties. 

**Pro Tip:** If you don’t have a good grasp on global history, sign up for a class at your local college or start reading books that cover topics relevant to current social or political issues. Again, read and study varying perspectives. 

1. **Political Events**

You’ll have plenty to choose from to write about political events! We recommend taking a similar approach to this as you would for an opinion piece––context is everything. If you view politics only through what you see happening in front of you, you may get a skewed and imbalanced view of things. 

**Action Step:** Pick a political event you’d like to write about, then look for articles that offer a roundup of the [most significant world events](https://www.cfr.org/blog/ten-most-significant-world-events-2022) in X year. Gather roundups from at least the past five years and see if you can trace how politics have progressed or regressed. 

**Pro Tip:** Want to get really serious? Do an intensive deep dive into political commentaries on the topic and read up on the history of that country or location. 

1. **Social Events**

Social events are lighter and a quicker news topic to cover, but can be just as interesting and relevant to local communities! Subscribe to local newsletters and magazines, and start [attending networking events](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/networking/) so you can be aware of events before they happen. If you’re covering social events, be prepared to interact with people attending the event, and make sure to take photos. 

### Travel And Adventure Stories

Magazines and online publications are always looking for travel and adventure stories, so if you like to travel, you _should_ be writing about it! There are several approaches you can take when writing about travel, so use these ideas if you’re overwhelmed by the thought of writing about your last adventure. 

To start writing travel and adventure, look for Facebook groups or other forums for the location that you’re visiting. People constantly post about their favorite restaurants and events that are happening, and you might even pick up interesting information from the latest local drama. Sometimes this is more reliable than online reviews or roundup posts written by people who have never set foot in the location they are writing about. 

Let’s get into seven different ideas for writing about travel and adventure. 

1. **Research Other Cultures**

You’ll have to do significant research to write about other cultures, but it’s definitely worth it. Learning about other cultures can be enriching and helps both you and your reader see the world in a new way. Try to research before traveling to learn about acceptable communication and avoid doing things that could be seen as offensive. 

While experiencing the culture, ask questions, go to places off the beaten path, and, most importantly, be respectful. 

**Pro Tip:** Avoid criticizing when writing about another culture, and please don’t objectify people. Or better yet, write about your own culture!

1. **Where to Stay**

Researching a good place to stay is often the most intimidating thing about traveling to a new place. So if you can write well about this, you’ll be meeting a real pain point for many people. 

When traveling, ask for local tips about neighborhoods that are less safe for foreigners or out-of-towners. You might ask someone where their family stays when they come to town or what hotels have a good reputation. 

Check out these top tips from Lonely Plant to make your travel writing even better.

1. **What to Do**

As a writer, think about what you can add to the conversation that makes it fresh. Skip all the regular tourist destinations, and do a deep dive into what makes a place special or exciting. Here are some fun ways to get a unique view of the place you’re visiting and gather unique suggestions for things to do.

- Get on a bus without a destination in mind.
- Stay at a bed and breakfast and interact with the owner.
- Hire a tour guide and ask them to take you to their favorite childhood hangout.

**Pro Tip:** Read a novel written by a local about the location you’re visiting. You’ll get an insider perspective on where you’re going and may learn about a location or fact that isn’t in the guidebooks. 

1. **What to Pack**

Packing the right things can make a trip more enjoyable or even downright frustrating. Use your knowledge of the location to suggest what people should pack. Here are some questions to help you put together a location-specific packing list.

- How do locals dress? 
- Are there religious or social customs around clothing that should be respected? 
- What is suitable footwear? 
- Do most people walk everywhere, take public transport, or drive?
- What adaptors are needed for electronics?
- Are there any safety concerns?
- What food is available for those with dietary restrictions? 
- What’s the weather like at specific times of the year?
- What over-the-counter medicine is available? 
- Is this a shopping destination, or is it remote and hard to get to shops of any kind? 

1. **Stresses and Challenges**

While travel and adventure can appear glamorous, countless stresses and challenges are involved. That’s the type of content that is interesting, so don’t feel like you need to censor or sanitize your travel experiences. Obviously, you need to think about your audience and what publication you’re writing for, but sharing challenges can make your experiences more relatable. 

1. **The Stories of People You Met**

Let’s start with the caveat––anytime you’re writing about other people, respect their privacy and their stories. 

With that in mind, when you travel, try to make human connections. It can be incredibly lonely when you’re traveling, especially in another country. And while it may be tempting to simply eat the food and see the sights, slow down a little and interact with locals in the location you’re visiting. After all, this is their home. Taking time to talk to others, ask questions, and even listen to their stories is a way to respect the environment you’re visiting as an outsider. 

> When you write about places, write about people. 

**Pro Tip:** Don’t just go for the spectacular beaches of Costa Rica. Go to hear the dancing melody of the Spanish language, talk to the artisans selling their handmade products, and meet the families growing coffee for generations.

Don’t just go to Singapore because you watched _Crazy Rich Asians_ and love boba tea. Go to learn about a country that was greatly altered by rapid urbanization and is considered one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world. Wherever you travel, go to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the local people.  

1. **Photo Essays**

If you love to write and take photos, the photo essay has been waiting for you to discover it! Photo essays offer an immersive experience for your reader. 

The photos should create a narrative or theme that your writing will support and expand on. 

**Types of photo essays:**

- Events such as protests or demonstrations, parades, or rallies
- A walking tour of a location
- Documenting the changes at a single place over a period of time 
- Street Fashion
- Day in the life
- Food from a specific culture, a single ingredient, or a roundup of food locations in a city.
- A religious tradition
- A common place in different locations. Such as public transportation, hotel rooms, restaurants, and beaches. For example, you would take photos of public transportation in each country or state you visit, and create a theme around the commonalities and differences.

### Things to Write About Yourself

Think about your family history within the context of time and place. Did you grow up with Florida sunsets, church barbeques, Bugs Bunny, and listening to 90s grunge? Or were you raised with miners’ strikes, Margaret Thatcher, and Jacob’s Trio biscuits?

2. **What was your favorite school hot lunch? Write a detailed scene about the smells, taste, and whether you ate alone or had lots of friends.**

### Things to Write Stories About

If you’re ready to write a novel or a short story, but don’t have any inspiration, try using [a plot generator](https://blog.reedsy.com/plot-generator/). We tested Reedsy, and it’s pretty fun! Here are some examples.  

1. **Mystery**

A veteran who is weary. A reporter who is deaf. It’s a family saga story about overcoming insecurities. It kicks off in a manor with a job offer. (Note that: someone in the story had a troubled childhood.) And there’s a twist! You should tell the story in epistolary form.

1. **Drama**

A detective who is cynical. A pilot who is poor. It’s a hardboiled PI story about blackmail. It kicks off at a farmhouse with news that a research institute’s confidential database has been hacked. (Note that: the case in this story will span four decades.) And there’s a twist! Everyone in the story dies.

1. **Romance**

A jockey who can be stubborn. A barista, who is cautious. It’s a romantic suspense story about standing up for oneself. It kicks off near a yard sale with a runaway cat. (Note that: both protagonists are always in the right place at the wrong time.) And there’s a twist! The two protagonists never manage to meet in person.

## **Tips & Tricks to Find Inspiration and Overcome Writer’s Block**

These are eight of our best tips and tricks to help you when writing feels like a drag. 

1. **Change your environment.** Go to a local cafe, restaurant, botanical garden, or park. The new setting can help clear your head and even give you a chance to people-watch for character development. 
2. **Know when to push through and when to stop.** Somedays, you just have to sit down and write. On other days, if writing is like pulling teeth, try taking a short walk or doing something different for the day. 
3. **Write about things that interest you.** There’s nothing worse than writing about a topic that makes you yawn. Even if it’s not a topic you’d like to write about, try to find a unique angle or something you can learn through the process. 
4. **Research more.** If you’re struggling to get through writer’s block, ditch writing and start researching. Make notes and even create stick figure drawings to capture concepts to reference later.
5. **Keep a journal.** Journaling can provide a rich source of inspiration for your writing practice. There’s no pressure because no one sees what you write in a journal, but it can help you get down thoughts and feelings or things you want to remember for a project down the road. 
6. **Get in a writer’s group.** Even if you’re an introvert, being in a supportive community can change everything for you as a writer. Writing can be lonely, and you need support to stay motivated, get fresh ideas, and have your ideas tested and pushed even further.
7. **Keep a source file.** Any time you come across an interesting study, article, or image, save that in a file or bookmark it on your computer. When you’re feeling bogged down or uninspired, cull through your sources to get inspiration. 
8. **Set goals.** Accomplishing even small goals like a weekly word count or writing time can give you a dopamine rush and motivate you to keep writing. 

Now that you have everything imaginable to write about, get going! We’re excited to imagine what you’ll produce. Curious about what a writing process looks like? Check out [Vanessa Van Edwards’s Writing Process for the book _Captivate_](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/my-writing-process/) and watch our video below:
