> Here are 7 steps to writing a great profile about yourself.
> 
> ### 1\. Lead with purpose
> 
> Before you write a profile, get clear on the reason you’re crafting it in the first place. How do you want to present yourself, and for what cause? 
> 
> Answer these 3 questions to uncover the purpose of your profile:
> 
> * **What is the goal of this profile?** If you are creating a professional profile for a job application, your tone and visuals will be far different than a social media profile intended to connect with your friends.
> * **Who is the target audience you want to attract?** Think of your profile as a customized advertisement to magnetize the exact friends, dates, or professional network you want in your life.
> * **Why are you on the app?** Are you using Bumble to find a potential spouse or to create casual connections? Do you prefer LinkedIn for casual networking opportunities, or is it essential for growing the income of your business? If you simply want to share inspirational snippets of your life with friends and family on Facebook, that’s great too! Stay clear on your intentions.

> ### 2\. Who is your audience?
> 
> Fishermen use a certain type of bait to catch a certain type of fish. If your business page or dating profile is attracting the wrong type of person, consider what “bait” you’re putting out. To do this, we can steal some strategies from marketing gurus.
> 
> The most successful businesses are deeply in-tune with their target customer. They know everything about this ideal purchaser of their products or services, including:
> 
> * How old they are
> * What gender they are
> * Where they live
> * Where they shop
> * What they enjoy doing
> 
> Of course, we are human beings and the details of our lives are far more nuanced than a product pitch. Nonetheless, keep this analogy in mind when designing your profile.

> **Pro Tip**: Use analytics to your advantage! Most social media apps offer detailed analytics about your followers and views. This is particularly important for business and influencer profiles, but it could be useful for personal profiles as well. If you want to see who you are attracting, this is a great starting point.
> 
> * [On Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/1533933820244654), click the lines in the top right and click “Insights.” These data are only available to professional and creator accounts.
> * On Twitter, [log in to analytics.twitter.com](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/using-the-tweet-activity-dashboard) with your Twitter username and password, then turn on analytics for your account.
> * On LinkedIn, use the [page analytics features](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a547077/linkedin-page-analytics?lang=en) or [targeting options](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ad-targeting/account-targeting?src=go-pa&trk=sem-ga%5Fcampid.19616910844%5Fasid.146115302392%5Fcrid.646161001914%5Fkw.%5Fd.c%5Ftid.dsa-1907948202141%5Fn.g%5Fmt.%5Fgeo.9029121&mcid=7024556915032477731&cid=&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7aqkBhDPARIsAKGa0oItYRpbaUaVy8s3OgXLDoqMdPXm-N-GmS0zs0EWf7EWkVF%5FRFOK-PEaAsjjEALw%5FwcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) for a business page.
> 
> Your virtual profile is like bait. Different types of fish prefer different food. What type of bait are you offering, and who will it attract? You don’t want a blurry picture in sweatpants if you intend to attract job recruiters on LinkedIn. Similarly, you may not want a wild party photo on your dating profile if you are seeking a serious relationship. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#268ba728-7eb7-44c8-a4d2-d6face5d7792) ^268ba728

> ### 3\. Use this formula
> 
> What makes you unique amongst 4.5 billion social media users? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#aeafaa96-77d7-4910-bf02-2897eb8c7185) ^aeafaa96

> A unique value proposition (UVP) is a brief sentence that explains what you offer to your audience. It clearly communicates what sets you apart and makes you valuable to the target audience you defined above. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#de5ed8cb-2081-4a60-a9f4-f76b2c00ded4) ^de5ed8cb

> Highlight your expertise, skills, accomplishment, and unique perspectives.
> 
> Your UVP explains your value in a quick statement. For example:
> 
> * “As a seasoned marketing strategist, I have a track record of 10x revenue for global brands. I help companies dominate their industry and stay ahead in a competitive landscape.”
> * “With 8 years as a pro athlete and 15 years in the fitness industry, I am the go-to coach for practical and motivational steps toward your dream body.”
> * “I help artists and creatives monetize their passions through social media and digital marketing.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#5e3f3f1e-939d-41a0-8513-8245efe57bad) ^5e3f3f1e

> For example, this LinkedIn profile perfectly displays a value formula. Within seconds, we know that this individual is a top consultant and career coach helping people find their dream job:

> 
> Depending on your platform, you can copy/paste this UVP at the top of your profile or in the introduction described below.
> 
> Remember, it helps to stick to the idea that you are selling yourself. Whether you’re selling your extraordinary work ethic, your inspirational video content portfolio, your freelance business services, or the idea of an amazing date or relationship, your profile is technically a sales page. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#e1363add-c83d-4f44-bf8d-857dc796fd3a) ^e1363add

> 4\. Upload a clear, smiling photo with open body language [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#583ac1fd-04b2-4743-859e-0b5f72150522) ^583ac1fd

> Science shows that people make a split judgment[1](#footnote-1)https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7320246 within 10 seconds of seeing something. The same applies to online interactions. Your profile picture is your [virtual first impression](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/first-impressions/). Either take a new profile photo or find an existing current picture that meets most of these criteria:
> 
> * Use a high-resolution smartphone or camera.
> * [Smile naturally](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/smile/) or wear a positive, approachable expression.
> * Uncross your arms to appear open and welcoming.
> * Choose a simple, neutral background that won’t distract from your face.
> * Dress according to your industry or context based on the audience.
> * Use bright, natural lighting if possible.
> * Look directly in the camera to create a sense of [connection through eye contact](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/making-eye-contact/).
> * Check that there are no shadows on your face.
> * Update your photo regularly (at least once per year) to reflex changes in your appearance. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-write-a-profile-like-a-pro-and-get-noticed-18c81b19bb0#04e63d6e-641c-4617-8de9-eed4c92d0302) ^04e63d6e

> ### 5\. Add a video
> 
> In addition to a profile picture, most platforms now allow you to upload videos. With social media moving toward video-centric content, a short introductory video is a great way to stand out. This 20-45 second clip can showcase your personality, voice, confidence, and expertise.
> 
> Don’t worry if you feel a little awkward on camera. The great thing about video is you can do as many takes as you need! You don’t need an influencer-worthy video clip. Instead, lean into your authenticity by:
> 
> * **Pre-writing a 2-3 sentence script**: This will likely be similar to your [personal elevator pitch](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/elevator-pitch/) that explains who you are and what you do. For example, I might say, “Howdy! I’m Logan— a freelance writer, editor, and content creator helping people live more vivacious, healthy lives. You can follow my adventures on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, and read my articles on ScienceofPeople.com.”
> * **Laughing before you start**: Laughter is proven to reduce stress[2](#footnote-2)https://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ijanm&volume=5&issue=3&article=016 and make us feel more relaxed in social settings. Even though you’re filming a video in your home or office, it is still a social endeavor where you want to present yourself as you would in person.
> * **Pretending like you’re talking to a friend**: A great profile video should feel like someone is meeting you in person. There is no need to be ultra-polished. Instead, act like you’re talking to a colleague or friend (while still remaining professional). Better yet, have someone stand behind the camera so it feels a bit more conversational.
