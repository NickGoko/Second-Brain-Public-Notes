> ### Choose a failure story
> 
> The first step is selecting a failure that is both real and impactful enough to share. Remember, everyone has failed at some point, so admitting to a mistake can actually make you more relatable.
> 
> If you’re struggling to think of something, keep in mind these 4 points:
> 
> * **Relevance:** Your failure should be relevant—for example, if you’re in a job interview for a marketing position, a failure related to a marketing campaign would be more relevant than, say, forgetting your friend’s birthday.
> * **Impact:** Choose a failure that had a real consequence, such as missing a deadline and losing out on a potential client.
> * **Learning Opportunity:** Your failure should ideally be something that spurred personal or professional growth. Did it make you reassess your priorities? Did it result in you acquiring new skills? Or perhaps you decided to delve into a great professional people skills gift: [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tell-me-about-a-time-you-failed-how-to-answer-like-a-pro-18c7f4429a4#5bd0e5e2-933c-4bee-9dfe-66519cfccc30) ^5bd0e5e2

> * **Recency:** While a failure from your distant past could still be relevant, something more recent may be more convincing as it shows your ability to adapt and learn in your current stage of life or career.
