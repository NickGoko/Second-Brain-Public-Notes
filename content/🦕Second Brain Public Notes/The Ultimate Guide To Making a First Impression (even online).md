> First impressions are everything!
> 
> The science proves it: most people make a first impression of a person within 7 seconds so you have to make it count. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#3cd61f04-2b72-478c-bdc8-f1fb8b03cea0) ^3cd61f04

> ## Why Are First Impressions Important?
> 
> A good first impression can land you a job, build stronger relationships, and even attract a partner. With a great start, you can strengthen your relationships and make future interactions go smoothly. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#ef2914de-3bd4-47b5-a878-1e954d598b77) ^ef2914de

> Studies have found that, on average, **our first impressions of people are 76% accurate.** This means we are pretty good at creating gut instincts. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#e0c632e4-3dd4-4496-8973-6c7df9619913) ^e0c632e4

> ### How long does it take to make a first impression?
> 
> Research shows that most people make a first impression of a person within 7 seconds. Experiments by [Princeton researchers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01750.x) even suggest that people can make accurate judgments of others within 1/10 of a second.

> below for some tips that apply to the virtual world so you can make a great first impression:
> 
> * **Step back.** Who likes seeing a face up-close? A good rule of thumb is to keep your camera back at least a foot and a half.
> * **Wave hello.** Since you can’t shake hands, my go-to is to wave hello. Waving is a great way to show friendliness and a great way to start any video call. It also shows your intentions and builds trust.
> * **Choose a clean background.** Dirty clothes, unorganized shelves, and peeling paint—these can all give the wrong impression.
> * **Add front lighting.** Have you ever gotten on a webcam and looked like a villain straight out of a Marvel movie? It could be due to your lighting. Professional light setups make sure lighting is in FRONT of you so your face is brightened. You don’t have to go professional, but whatever you do, make sure the light isn’t behind you.
> * **Look at the dot.** Most people make the mistake of looking at the screen. But there’s a problem: no eye contact! Look straight into the webcam when saying your hellos to make a great first impression.
> * **Wear pants.** You won’t believe how many people wear inappropriate shorts to a business call. Or even worse… no pants at all! Wearing appropriate attire not only gets you in the right mindset, but it also saves you from a potentially embarrassing situation.

> ## Step #1: Thin-Slicing
> 
> When it comes to first impressions though, it’s not just [body language](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/quiz/) and your clothes that matter. [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661314002095) shows that your facial features play a huge role in how people perceive you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#7486f1b7-cdfd-4772-8692-d73b7cf056f3) ^7486f1b7

> Other studies have found that we not only decide if we like someone in the first few seconds, but also that the first impression stays with us.
> 
> Princeton University psychologist [Alex Todorov](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2006/08/22/snap-judgments-decide-faces-character-psychologist-finds) had people look at a microsecond of video of a political candidate. 
> 
> > Amazingly, research subjects could predict with 70% accuracy who would win the election just from that microsecond of tape.
> 
> This tells us that people can make incredibly accurate snap judgments in a tenth of a second.

> 
> Making a good first impression is incredibly important for you because you only get one shot at it. I know this sounds harsh, but <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">as humans we are conditioned to judge people within the first second of meeting them—and our opinion often doesn’t change.</mark>
> 
> This is called thin-slicing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#214691cb-c737-4285-88d4-31048c59acb8) ^214691cb

> **What is thin-slicing?**
> 
> **Thin-slicing** is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">when we take a mental snapshot of someone and guess their competence, confidence and likability in less than a second.</mark> Researchers think this is a survival mechanism that we have developed to decide very quickly if someone is friend or foe. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#6eec96ef-d75f-46da-8881-1af721e15afb) ^6eec96ef

> Malcolm Gladwell’s book, [_Blink_](http://gladwell.com/blink/), points to 3 important principles of thin-slicing you should know about:
> 
> **#1: Snap judgments save us time and energy**
> 
> We don’t judge without reason—thin-slicing helps.
> 
> Gladwell gives one example of the psychologist [Nalini Ambady](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a920/32341de4ca3d1551095c86506af7b54150f4.pdf), who found that if she gave college students a silent two second clip of a teacher to watch, they could then thin-slice the effectiveness of that teacher.
> 
> And the most interesting part is they came to the same conclusions about the teacher as students who sat in class with that teacher for an entire semester. This study shows that most of the time, your gut feeling may be right. If you’re walking down the sidewalk and another person approaches you, your gut instinct may kick in—and perhaps, it could even save your life.
> 
> I want you think about how you’ve thin-sliced someone in your own life:
> 
> * Have you ever had a gut feeling about someone…and found out later you were right?
> * Have you ever had a good feeling about someone…and found out later you were wrong? What happened?
> * From now on, pay attention to your gut reaction the next time you meet someone new and then follow-up with your gut. Were you right? Wrong? Start learning from your mistakes.
> 
> **#2: Your judgments about others can be changed**
> 
> One of the most fascinating examples in the book is with Dr. John Gottman. He runs a “Love Lab” at the University of Washington and has been able to apply thin-slicing to videos of married couples talking, and turn them into a remarkably accurate marriage predictability tool.
> 
> If he watches a couple talk, not fight, just talk, for an hour, he has a 95% success rate in determining if they will still be married in 15 years. Yet, even if he watches for just 15 minutes, that rate is still at 90%.
> 
> Now, you might think Dr. Gottman is a savant when it comes to this kind of thing, that he has great gut instincts for interpersonal dynamics.
> 
> Not quite. It all boils down to what he calls, “the four horsemen:”[[The Gottman Four Horsemen]]
> 
> * Defensiveness
> * Stonewalling
> * Criticism
> * Contempt
> 
> The one that really sticks out to Dr. Gottman, the feeling that can be thin-sliced out of all the thin-slicing is contempt.
> 
> What he really does, and teaches his students to do, is look for that tell-tale sign of contempt. When you’re able to focus in on one thing and know what you’re looking for, separating the signal from the noise so to speak, suddenly the answer appears.
> 
> To illustrate the point, Dr. Gottman’s [divorce prediction test](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/) was re-worked and broken down by a group of psychologists. They came up with a list of things to look for, including the four horsemen, and then gave the videos and lists to non-experts.
> 
> These non-experts watched the videos in 30 second chunks, twice, using their list of things to look for and then were asked to predict.
> 
> The results?
> 
> The non-experts hit a just over 80% accuracy rate on which marriages were going to still be going strong in 15 years.
> 
> So, not only can thin-slicing be taught, but it turns out (unsurprisingly) we all have a little bit of it inside ourselves already. In fact, many of the experts were able to teach either Gladwell or someone else how to thin-slice effectively without incredible amounts of time or effort.
> 
> This plays right into the concept that we can actually tap into our unconscious and learn how to use it more effectively. The key is learning what exactly to look for. Here is what contempt looks like, a simple one-sided mouth raise:

> 
> **#3: We have inherent biases** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-first-impression-even-online-18c7f17c826#a29e2372-9fa2-4e52-a6e0-27a61d8a3389) ^a29e2372

> **Bottom line:** People have their own inherent biases, so sometimes it might feel like a never-winning task to make a good first impression, no matter how hard you try. Don’t be hard on yourself! But that’s no excuse to be lazy. There ARE techniques you can use to change the way others perceive you, so you can have a slight edge when people make their snap judgments.

> Let’s be totally honest right now. When people first meet you, What do you think they think of you? In other words, how do you think you come across?
