  : The fear of people
- [00:00:55](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=55.04801)
	- Do not fear those can kill the body but no cannot kill the soul.
- [00:05:34](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=334.615377) - Focus on the one 1 not the 99. The road is narrow. So you will never satisfy the 99. Being a christian will never be about the 99 it will be 1%
- [00:07:01](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=421.15338) Healthy -apathetic to materialism. A respect for how living for people could be. 
	- unhealthy fear of people - looks obsessive.  
- [00:08:00](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=480.531749) they want Jesus to keep making bread for them. He knew their heart
- [00:09:42](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=582.026009) Nothing that is covered will remain hidden
- [00:10:02](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=602.097971) Fearing men will quiet your spiritual gift. 
- [00:10:57](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=657.145376) True freedom is not saying you don't have to listening to anyone. Its about being able to truly do what you deep down in your soul want to do. Because bad people don't want to always be known for those bad things. 
- [00:11:24](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=684.516043) If they apostles had gone out withe fear of people they would not have done what God had called them to do. 
- - [00:11:31](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=691.468454) ==I want to serve God in a big way but i am afraid of what people are going to say. How people are gonna look at me.
- That is not freedom. "If you hear me whisper it to you, then proclaim it on rooftops"
- - [00:11:50](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=710.770338) Do not fear those who can kill the body but fear he who can kill the soul and the body. The worse they can do to you is kill you. The best thing for christian is death, its a promotion because you get to be with God. 
- [00:12:53](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=773.917274) Destroy is eternal. God can destroy both soul and body. 
- [00:13:55](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=835.321867) If you go around fearing people you can never understand your value.  
[00:14:52](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=892.78668) The image of God is on me. Not because of how cute or smart or where you live or know not because of your talents. Without Christ, we are dead. We are valuable because we belong to God. ==It's who you belong to, not what you have done
- [00:16:42](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1002.71391) If he cares for the sparrows. It means he knows every single thing that happens to you. No matter how small.
- [00:16:43](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1003.278923) If God cares for each of the sparrows. It means he knows every moment in my life. Every time i fall or something bad happens to me or every time i fear man.
- [00:17:13](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1033.225155) The number of your hairs are numbered. He knows everything about his children.
- [00:18:14](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1094.97727) When you stop fearing people,, you start to realize your value. We are so concerned how people treat us, think about us, see us. We don't stop to **see how valuable we are to God**, not because we are good looking or smart or dandy. But because we are his.
- [00:18:17](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1097.17668) When you stop fearing people, you see your value. What people are going to say or treat us, what people think about us. You don't stop to think how valuable we are to God. And not because of anything other than we are his. His people and his creation. Creation, to which he sacrificed his only son for us. 

>[!insight]
>- You are truly love and valued. How are you not valuing yourself. If God values you, who are you not value yourself. Its an insult to God. Are you saying you know better than God?  
>[[⚖️For when i feel short]]
- [00:18:38](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1118.393065) When you subject yourself to other people's opinion you start to thing your life belongs to them. You have subjected yourself to their opinion. 
- They are probably not thinking about you. But you are giving up your life and subject it to their opinion. You have lost sight on the vision of God. His vision is on you. Let your vision be on him.  
- Your LIFE belongs to God
- [00:20:09](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1209.365983) ==Everyone who acknowledge me before men i will also acknowledge before my father. He who denies me before men i will also deny before my father in heaven. 
- **This means there eternal consequences to fear of men**
- [00:21:11](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1271.255983) To not fear people you would be able to walk in confidence and acknowledge God regardless of who they were. - [00:21:50](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1310.141851) we are here because the apostles choose not live in the fear of men but in the fear of God. And because of that they will be acknowledge by Jesus. 
> You could die any day and find yourself before Jesus either acknowledging you before God or denying you before God. 

>[!insight]  
> **The Question of the new testament is less on do you know God. Its does God know you**  
> When you get to heaven will Jesus say depart from me i never knew you. Is he going to welcome you?  
> Or is Jesus going to yell your name or embrace you because he knows your.  
> For God to know you it mean you are intimate with God, do you have a relationship with God

>[!highlight]  
>**How do we reject the fear of men ?!**  
>We have to see Jesus and how he always acknowledged the father before men. We never put acceptance and popularity over his loyalty to God. Never once event when he was tempted. 
>- [00:25:43](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1543.639382) Was Jesus was not devoured so we can be treated as a child of God. He had no business to be treated like that. Only for us.
>- He was tortured, beaten and treated like a sparrow so we can be treated as child of God

- [00:26:02](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1562.495686) Am i being loyal to God or am i being loyal to man?
- [00:26:35](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1595.858238) Why would i fear mean when the worse thing they can do is kill me. 
- - [00:27:23](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1643.969275) Looking to Christ means you are looking at your value, meanings you are looking at your future. Looking at your eternity with him. 
- [00:27:58](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=Androphobia+&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Fs%2F6fbe784%2Fpodcast%2Frss&time=1678.284764) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Do not look for inner strength</mark>. The more introspective you get the more fearful of people you get. The more you look for reasons within yourself for reasons not to fear people. All you will find is more darkness. Things to be ashamed of. 

> What scare you about people?  
Afraid of what people will think about me.  
What God thinks of us is what matters. Out of obedience.  
I think people have power over me. When it doesn't matter. 

>What is my motivation?  
Is it because of people? I should only care if God cares.
