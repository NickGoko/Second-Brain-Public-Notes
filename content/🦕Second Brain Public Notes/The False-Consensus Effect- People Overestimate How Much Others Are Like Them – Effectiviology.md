## Highlights

> The _false-consensus effect_ is a [cognitive bias](https://effectiviology.com/cognitive-biases/) that causes people to overestimate how much others are like them, in terms of sharing things such as their beliefs, values, characteristics, experiences, and behaviors. Essentially, this means that the false consensus effect leads people [to assume](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1031%2885%2990020-4) that others are [more similar](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2017.09.001) to them than they actually are.

> For example, the false consensus effect can cause someone with extreme political beliefs to incorrectly assume that the majority of the population agrees with them and shares those beliefs, even though most people don’t.

> ## Examples of the false-consensus effect
> 
> One example of the false-consensus effect is someone [believing](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.1982.9924429) that the political candidate that they favor has more support in the population than other candidates, even when that isn’t the case.
> 
> Another example of the false consensus effect is that racist people often [believe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2005.10.004) that their racist views are prevalent among their peers, even when that isn’t the case.

> ## The psychology and causes of the false-consensus effect
> 
> The false-consensus effect can be attributed to several potential psychological mechanisms: [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#cd688d44-2853-4734-aa4d-b25e89c810d6)  ^cd688d44

> **Motivated reasoning.** This reflects people’s desire to feel good about themselves, primarily by [believing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2017.09.001) that their opinions, experiences, and behaviors are normative and [common](https://doi.org/10.1037/0893-164X.14.3.295), so they conform with others. This is associated with _self-enhancement_ and the _self-serving bias_, which involve increasing people’s self-esteem. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#e048ee2c-fc36-46b1-aef3-b3a900b18f60)  ^e048ee2c

> **Biased exposure to information.** Most notably, people tend to [spend more time](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.102.1.72) interacting with individuals who [share](https://doi.org/10.1037/0893-164X.14.3.295) their opinions, experiences, and behaviors than with those who do not, which can bias their perception of what most people are like. Furthermore, people may experience similar biased exposure to information when it comes to other things, such as articles that they read or shows that they watch. This phenomenon itself is associated with various concepts, such as _selective exposure_ to [confirmatory information](https://effectiviology.com/confirmation-bias/), for example through echo chambers on [social media](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106947). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#5413fd8f-8fa8-4b70-ae7d-333d31deb9c5)  ^5413fd8f

> **Cognitive availability.** People generally find it [easier](https://doi.org/10.1086/524416) to think about their own opinions, experiences, and behaviors than about those of others, which can lead them to project those viewpoints and experiences onto others. This is associated with the _availability heuristic_, which causes people to rely more strongly on information that is easy for them to bring to mind. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#da345286-3085-45ee-9290-d9a2730c9c1b)  ^da345286

> **Focus of attention.** People are generally [more focused](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.102.1.72) on what they are thinking and doing than on what others are thinking and doing, which causes them to assume that others are thinking and doing the same thing that they are. This can be due to various reasons, such as that information about oneself is generally [more salient](https://doi.org/10.1006/jesp.1995.1002) to people than information about others. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#612e2320-6cb6-45f2-b8b3-f72755801c5d)  ^612e2320

> **Anchoring.** When individuals try to assess other people’s perspective, when it comes to things such as their thoughts and experiences, they may use their own perspective as an initial anchor, and then fail to adjust from it sufficiently. This type of flawed anchoring-and-adjustment can also lead to [other forms](https://effectiviology.com/egocentric-bias/) of _assumed similarity_ between one’s current perspective and some other perspective. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#810ae96d-ad49-4666-8e61-630c55bda1d0)  ^810ae96d

> Several of these mechanisms may [play a role](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.102.1.72) in a given situation, and a person might experience the false-consensus effect for any number of them. These mechanisms are also sometimes interrelated, for example in the case where motivated reasoning leads people to be [selective](https://effectiviology.com/ostrich-effect/) in the information that they engage with.
> 
> Furthermore, other factors may also play a role in causing the false-consensus effect in some cases. For example, when people [view their thoughts and actions](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.45.3.550) as being driven by situational factors, they may have attributional issues, and overestimate the prevalence of these factors or the likelihood that they will [influence](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0146167295215005) other people the same way.
> 
> In addition, there is substantial [variability](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1011472501737) when it comes to [whether](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.45.3.688) people [display](https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2010.54533202) the false-consensus effect and how strongly they [do so](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-016-9489-0), due to [various](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0093650218794854) personal and situational factors. For example, people may be [more motivated](https://doi.org/10.1006/jesp.1995.1002) to [overgeneralize](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0146167284101015) about attitudes that are important to them, such as their political beliefs, than attitudes that are less important, such as their food preferences, though this factor itself [doesn’t always](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0146167295215005) play a role. Similarly, the degree to which people display the false consensus effect for a certain opinion can be influenced by whether their opinion is [actually shared](https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfn056) by the majority of the population or not.
> 
> Finally, in some cases, such as when people [don’t have](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0272989X20904960) much contact with others who share their experiences, they may [display](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0146167203029005001) the [opposite pattern of thinking](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00006.x) instead, called the _false-uniqueness effect_, whereby they [underestimate](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158382) how much others are like them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#9ae54f58-f11d-4c3f-a9d0-aac6dd40f93b)  ^9ae54f58

> This opposite pattern of thinking is also associated with the concept of _pluralistic ignorance_, which occurs when people [believe](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.64.2.243) that their private views are different from those of others even though their public behavior is similar, meaning that they tend to underestimate (rather than overestimate) how much others share their views. This phenomenon can lead to situations where all members in a group [privately reject the group norms](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.53.2.298), while at the same time believing that the other group members accept them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#bb715669-4708-49d0-aaa9-214cae784c9b)  ^bb715669

> Overall, the false-consensus effect can be attributed to several partly interrelated causes, including motivated reasoning, biased exposure to information, increased cognitive availability of certain information, increased focus on certain information, and using one’s own perspective as an anchor when assessing other people’s perspective. Other factors may also play a role when it comes to this effect, and there is substantial variability in terms of whether people display it, how strongly they do so, and whether they display an opposite false-uniqueness effect instead.
> 
> _Note_: the false-consensus effect is a form of _social projection_, and the term “projection bias” is [sometimes](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F107769900107800405) used to [refer](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0093650203253366) to it. In addition, this effect is also [considered](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.79.1.66) to be a [type](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.596) of _[egocentric bias](https://effectiviology.com/egocentric-bias/)_.

> ## How to deal with the false-consensus effect
> 
> To reduce the false-consensus effect, you can use the following debiasing techniques:
> 
> * **Increase awareness of this bias.** For example, you can learn what this bias is and what causes it, identify specific situations in which you might display it, and actively ask yourself whether you might be experiencing it. However, keep in mind that simply being aware of this bias is often insufficient when it comes to avoiding it, since people can [continue to display it](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.596) even when they are aware of it, and even when they are told that their estimates are biased.
> * **Engage with alternative perspectives.** You can do this in various ways, such as by talking to people with different perspectives than you, or by thinking about what those different perspectives might be. This can be beneficial in various ways, such as by making you aware of these other perspectives, making it easier to consider them, and increasing their salience.
> * **Compare your perspective with those of others.** For example, you can try to identify [positive aspects](https://doi.org/10.1086/524416) of alternative perspectives, or [negative aspects](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-002-1020-0) of your own perspective. This can help you engage with the alternative perspectives, and can help you assess the involved perspectives in a rational manner.
> * **Consider what caused you to develop your perspective, and what could cause others to develop a different perspective.** For example, you can consider what aspects of your personality led you to act a certain way, and how other people’s personalities might differ from yours in a way that leads them to make different choices.
> * **Create psychological** **_[self-distance](https://effectiviology.com/self-distancing-rational-decisions/)_ from your perspective.** You can accomplish this, for example, by using second and third-person language when thinking about your views (e.g., “why do _you_ believe this?”).
> * **Change your motivational considerations.** For example, you can focus on how just because your opinion is different than the opinion of the majority, that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s something wrong with you.
> * **Use general** **[debiasing techniques](https://effectiviology.com/cognitive-debiasing-how-to-debias/).** These include, for example, slowing down your reasoning process and improving your decision-making environment. Furthermore, you will likely particularly benefit from debiasing techniques that address the specific causes of your false-consensus effect (e.g., waiting to make an estimate when you’re in an environment that minimizes pressure from close peers).
> * **Look at concrete data.** For example, if you’re unsure what proportion of the population supports your favorite political candidate, then instead of estimating, try to find reliable sources that provide the relevant information. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#e96ea29f-988d-4a2e-8930-f4a90b2fe5c2)  ^e96ea29f

> You can also use these techniques not only to reduce your own false-consensus effect, but also to reduce the false-consensus effect that other people display. You can do this in various ways, such as teaching them about this bias and letting them debias themselves, helping them implement debiasing techniques, or implementing debiasing techniques directly on their behalf. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#099c4571-a8ad-4d55-a73d-1d42513d7f85)  ^099c4571

> In addition, being aware of the false-consensus effect can be useful when it comes understanding and predicting people’s thoughts and actions, even if you don’t intend to reduce it directly. For example, it can help you predict that extremists will overestimate the prevalence of their views in the population, which can be useful when predicting their behavior, even if you can’t reduce the bias that they experience. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#e862b909-2b67-4ec6-b910-859ccb87acdf)  ^e862b909

> Finally, when dealing with the false-consensus effect, it’s important to remember that there is a lot of variability involved. This means that people won’t always display this bias, that they may display it in different ways and to different degrees, and that people may sometimes display an opposite effect instead, where they underestimate how much others are like them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-false-consensus-effect-people-overestimate-how-much-others-a-18e0018b46e#1e0be69a-f253-4888-a9c7-62e62e04fd34)  ^1e0be69a
