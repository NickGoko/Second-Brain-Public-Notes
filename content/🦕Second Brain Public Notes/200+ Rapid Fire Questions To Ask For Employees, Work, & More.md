You’ve probably heard of icebreaker questions—they’re used in groups to break the ice so people can get to know each other. Companies play these games all the time as team-building activities and to foster deeper working relationships among employees.

However, sometimes it’s more fun to speed these games up and get people thinking on their feet—cue, rapid-fire questions. 

Let’s face it—getting to know someone becomes more complicated the older you are. Studies show that you can build casual friendships<sup id="footnote-sup-1"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/rapid-fire-questions/#footnote-1">1</a></sup> after 30 hours and closer ones after 50 hours—best friends typically emerge after spending 300 hours together.
