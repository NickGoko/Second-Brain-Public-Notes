**"7 Differences Between Dopamine (Pleasure) and Serotonin (Happiness):**

1. Pleasure is short-term, like a meal, while happiness is long-term, akin to a lifetime.
2. Pleasure is visceral, felt in the body, whereas happiness is ethereal, experienced above the neck.
3. Pleasure is about taking, such as winning in a casino, while happiness involves giving, like contributing to Habitat for Humanity.
4. Pleasure is often achieved alone, for example, when eating a chocolate cake, while happiness is typically found in social groups, such as at a birthday party.  
5. Pleasure can be achieved with substances like cocaine, heroin, nicotine, alcohol, sugar, and through some addictive behaviors. In contrast, happiness cannot be achieved through substances.
6. Extremes of pleasure, whether involving substances or behaviors like shopping, gambling, social media, internet use, gaming, pornography, or overeating, can lead to addiction. There are terms like 'shopaholic,' 'alcoholic,' 'sexaholic,' and 'chocoholic' associated with excessive pleasure, but there is no equivalent for being addicted to too much happiness.
7. Pleasure is associated with dopamine, while happiness is linked to serotonin.
	1. These two neurotransmitters involve different areas of the brain, regulatory pathways, mechanisms of action, and driving forces. Dopamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons thrive on stimulation but do not respond well to overstimulation, which can lead to neuronal cell death due to their high metabolic activity.
	2. Despite having an abundance of dopamine molecules, there are fewer receptors, which means that fewer molecules can find the receptors. This results in the phenomenon known as tolerance, where you need more and more to achieve the same effect.
	3. Dopamine can lead to tolerance and, when neurons begin to die, it's referred to as addiction. Serotonin, on the other hand, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. There's no risk of overdosing on happiness, but dopamine can downregulate serotonin.
	4. Seeking more and more pleasure can lead to unhappiness. The key differences lie in reward and contentment, pleasure and happiness. For example, Coca-Cola provides pleasure, not happiness. It's essential not to chase pleasure (dopamine), as it can make you unhappier. To boost serotonin, consider factors like diet, exercise, exposure to bright light, supplements, massage, mood regulation, stress management, and adequate sleep."

## Pleasure Pain Balance
- The move you seek pleasure the stronger the opposite reaction of pain. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Like a see-saw, when you tip you the dopamine scale too much one side the more the scale tips on the other side, to attain homeostasis. </mark>
- You need to seek discomfort so that you can get an equal positive reaction on the other side.
