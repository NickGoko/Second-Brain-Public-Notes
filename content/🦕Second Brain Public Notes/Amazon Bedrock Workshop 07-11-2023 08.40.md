- Within this series of labs, you will be taken through some of the most common usage patterns we are seeing with our customers for Generative AI. 
- We will explore techniques for 
	- generating text and images, 
	- creating value for organizations by improving productivity. 
- This is achieved by leveraging foundation models to help in ==composing emails, summarizing text, answering questions, building chatbots, creating images and generating code==. 
- You will gain hands-on experience using Bedrock APIs, SDKs, and open-source software for example *LangChain* and FAISS to implement these usage patterns.
