## Questions About Values and Goals

It is also helpful to ask some thought-provoking questions about hypothetical scenarios like “If you could time travel, what time period would you go to?” This allows them to talk about their values in a hypothetical situation without feeling pressured to reveal more profound stories if they don’t want to.

43. What is your number one goal for the coming year?

**Pro Tip**: There is a certain balance you have to strike between expressing interest in someone versus being too nosey. You don’t want to violate their privacy or go too deep too quickly. 

It’s usually best to steer clear of certain types of questions early on in a friendship: for example, “who did you vote for?”, “what are your religious beliefs?” or “what’s the worst thing that ever happened to you?” are probably best saved for someone you’ve known for a while. 

On the other hand, if you notice someone is sharing more about themselves, move on to more profound questions like the ones below.

## Deep Questions to Ask Your Friends

When you want to get to know someone deeper, it is often helpful to open up about your own stories and viewpoints.

Psychologists have found that an equal amount of give-and-take[5](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/questions-to-ask-your-friends/#footnote-5) is essential to make both people in a conversation feel comfortable to disclose more intimate details about their lives.

However, over-sharing can lead to[6](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/questions-to-ask-your-friends/#footnote-6) awkwardness or embarrassment. Self-disclosure requires trust that you can only build through time and conversation. So only dig into these types of questions once you’ve already started to form a relationship with somebody.
