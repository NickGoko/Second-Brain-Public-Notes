## Highlights

> Do believers take more risks, thinking God will ultimately save them from bad outcomes, or do they take fewer, fearing God would want them to feel the effects of risky decisions? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/thinking-about-god-may-encourage-risk-taking-big-think-18e2730b025#fd843f44-f2f0-4b05-acd1-53c10908eb39) ^fd843f44

> > Thinking about God made believers slightly more willing to take future risks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/thinking-about-god-may-encourage-risk-taking-big-think-18e2730b025#4e69b594-af92-4591-9034-7a839c0ee56a) ^4e69b594

> To try to tease out the influence of their beliefs about God, they broke them into two groups: The experimental group was told “Before you answer these questions, please think about God’s influence over what happens in your life. Think about your likelihood of engaging in this risky activity or behavior, after considering God’s influence over your life.”
> 
> The control group was merely told to “think about your likelihood of engaging in this risky activity or behavior.” The idea was that by _priming_ the idea of God, any influence their beliefs about God might have on their decision-making would be emphasized, at the forefront of their mind. It turns out thinking about God made believers slightly more willing to take future risks.

> Should people take more risks? Some studies suggest that the answer is _yes._ People (and other animals) [tend to be irrationally risk averse](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08242), preferring safer options to risky ones with a higher expected value. But belief in God, it seems, can provide a psychological safety net.
