## Highlights

> “Good checklists \[...\] provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps--the ones that even the highly skilled professional using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-essential-speaker-checklist-speaker-hub-18e176b8cce#9ddf14f4-e814-441d-a94a-ea2571c595bc)  ^9ddf14f4

> With a million things to remember before your presentation, forgetting a key element can put you off kilter, and even jeopardize your ability to deliver your talk.
> 
> With this in mind, we have drawn on our collective experience here at SpeakerHub to create this useful checklist for public speakers.
> 
> We wanted to convert these ideas into a very practical format, so we created a one-page PDF checklist that you can print off and change to suit your needs.
> 
> Items are grouped by category, and you can add your own items and notes, as well as some of the finer details for the event.
