The best questions to keep a conversation going with a girl, guy, or nonbinary person always align with their interests. Asking if they like dogs or cats could prompt them to delve into their past. Maybe they prefer one over the other due to their family history or a sweet memory that made them bond with a pet.

It’s also more of an open-ended question than you might think. Your conversation partner might not prefer either. If they don’t, you can encourage them to talk more about their favorite animals or the pets they wished they had.

You’ll instantly bond with someone if they share your love for dogs or cats. Bring up this easygoing discussion topic, and you’ll get to know someone better than if you asked how their day was going.

Quote 1: “Guiding a conversation from beginning to end makes you a leader in your social groups.”

### Job Interviews

So many things are on your mind when you sit down for a job interview. You want to showcase your skills and experience effectively, which can cause you to worry that you won’t fit everything into a short conversation.

You may also feel the stress of getting a job with a higher salary. The extra money could fund your dream adventures, reduce your financial anxiety, or help you advance to milestones like starting a family.

It’s easy to prepare for standard job interview questions, but the recruiter might also make small talk to get to know you better. Feeling assured in your ability to lead a conversation will help you make better impressions during these moments. You’ll feel confident about listening and responding to questions without making the conversation all about yourself.

Even if you don’t get to ask deep questions because the small talk portion of the interview passes by too quickly, you’ll still project the confidence the recruiter might search for in a good candidate. They’ll also note how you’ll fit in with their workplace compared to others who might be too shy to contribute to a team environment.

Consider a few of these questions to walk into your next interview with more confidence:

- What’s one way technology has changed your career here for the better?
- What’s the greatest office party you’ve ever attended here?
- What’s one word that describes the camaraderie in this workplace?

### First Dates

Even if you’ve talked with a potential first date over a dating app for a few days, meeting in person can create the potential for awkward silences. It is easier to talk over text because your potential partner isn’t right there waiting for you to say something.

Learning about and practicing conversation prompts will give you the confidence to use awkward silences to think of meaningful topics worth waiting for. You’ll know how to create deeper connections by finding common ground and building trust through tone and body language.

Your date nights are about to get much better if you start the evening with one of these thought-provoking questions:

- What’s the coolest pet you’ve ever owned?
- What’s the most relaxing place in the world for you?
- What’s a niche type of news story that makes you excited?

### Parties with Friends

You might feel at ease while hanging out with one of your close friends, but anxiety can arise when they host a party with people you haven’t met. That’s when it’s most helpful to know questions to keep a conversation going. You’ll be able to connect with anyone based on topics that work with people from all walks of life.

Break the ice with questions like these that instantly help everyone bond:

- What’s the craziest experience you’ve ever had while working?
- Did you ever create your own ringtone, and if so, what was it?
- Have you ever performed in a show?

**Fun Tip:** You can save conversation prompts on your phone so they’re always within reach. Even if your mind goes blank when talking to a stranger, you can avoid awkward silences by picking a prompt from your list.

## How to Keep a Conversation Going Without Asking Questions

If you’re continually asking questions, your casual conversation or first date could feel like they’re on an unplanned interview. It might make them feel uncomfortable. That’s knowing how to keep a conversation going without asking questions is vital.

First, acknowledge any of your inner discomfort with silence. You may ask rapid-fire questions because you’re anxious about keeping the other person entertained. Acknowledge the silence to remove its power, then remind yourself that you are stronger than any fear.

Instead of asking more questions, share something about yourself. It could relate to the last question your partner answered or steer the conversation in a new direction. You’ll move the presumed spotlight onto yourself and eliminate any tension.

There’s also strength in knowing when a conversation can end. Give the other person space if they pull away from you. You could also thank them for meeting you on your date and say how much you look forward to your next one.

## Takeaway: Improve Your Conversation Skills With Deep Questions

Anyone can become a better conversationalist. You only have to learn how to actively listen, overcome any fear of awkward silences, and bring up topics that engage your conversation partner, such as:

- What vacations are on your bucket list?
- What’s your favorite childhood food and why?
- What’s your biggest personal dream?
- What would have been your backup career?
- What’s a hobby you’d like to learn?

Use these prompts to converse with anyone. As you practice your conversation skills, you’ll invent variations on these prompts to find what works best for those in your social circle.
