#### The Dream Career Matrix
  - Most people are focused on execution-networking, resume, networking events. 
  - But only focusing execution without clarity you will end up **Unfullfilled.**
  - But if you have clarity without execution you end up as a frustrated candidate.
  - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">If you don't have either execution and and clarity you end feeling like an invisible candidate. </mark>
  - Having both execution and clarity you end up being a [Star candidate](#).

### The Four Steps to Being the Star Candidate.
![[Screenshot 2023-10-28 at 20.30.27.png]]
1. Fuel
	- The one thing costing you your dream career is your self doubt. Tale of two candidates
		- Job search negative mindset- "Doubt that you do it", "Job searching is hard", "they are no hiring for these roles", "I am too old"
		- Job search positive mindset - "Employers are looking for me right now", "Employers are looking for what i offering"  
	Which candidate are you?  
	Why do we find ourselves as candidate number 1?
		- Your brain wants you to be stuck. 
		- Your brain wants to keep the status quo. It doesn't want to change.
		- You need to confront the self doubt. Because when adversity comes up when you do have the job you may give in to those thought. ![[Screenshot 2023-10-28 at 20.35.56.png]]
	- What working through self doubt looks like:![[Screenshot 2023-10-28 at 20.48.56.png]]
	- Focus on Belief in you, Belief in Employers & Belief in what you offer
		- [Belief in me](#) = Belief i have value. 
		- Find the facts that proves i have value to show your brain you have value. Redirect those thoughts and feelings of self doubt.
		- [What i have to offer](#) = Employers have what i have to offer. We have unique skills and experiences. 
		- [Belief in Employers](#) = Employers are looking for star candidates because they are so hard to find. They are desperate for star candidates. Employers are looking for me.
