# [Obstacles on the road to God's will](#)

  **Self will**
- We want our way and then ask God to bless it.
- How many times have you step out of the will of God?

**Influence of other people**
- God is willing to show you anything about any area of your life if you are willing to listen. 
- Be careful listening to people or putting their opinions above God's. They are not you, they don't know God plans for you. 

**Ignorance of God's principles**
- You cannot walk in the will of God if you don't know his principles. 
- God's principles
	- Learning to wait on God. 
	- Learning to trust God and leaving all the consequence to him. 
	- God will supply our needs.
	- Walk in the will of God one step at a timeyou will not see the full picture. 

**Willful know sin**
- Effects of willful sin
	- _Deafens our ears to the voice of God._ you no longer hear God as clear as he wants you to listen. 
	- _Blinds our eyes to the vision of God_ - you will not be happy in life if you don't know where you are headed.  
	- _Hardens our hearts to our awareness of God_ - <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">disobedience to God always hardens your heart.</mark> You stumble along the way because you allow sin into your heart that is a distraction and they get side tracked, while God's best is ahead of them.  
		  Stop asking why don't understand how God treats you the way he treats you......Its the way your treat him. You are not listening to him, you are not obeying him. Things are not going to work out for me. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">There is no promise in God's word that says he is going to bless your sin, disobedience and indifference to me.</mark> 
	- _Dulls our conscience to the Word of God_ - When you read the word of God and say it is not speaking to youits because you are living in disobedience to him. You are not listening to him, you have your own mind and heart made up.  

Anything that deafens my ears to him, blinds my eyes to him, hardens my heart to God and dulls my conscience to him, **I am in trouble**. When you are out of the will of God you begin to sense something is not right. 

**Doubt**
- When we doubt God we make the wrong decisions. 
- When i am doubting what am i doubting: 
	- That God has a will for me personally. 
	- I am doubting that God will make his will known. He will make his will known because he loves us. 
	- We doubt what we hear from Godwe doubt because what we hear may sound too good. 
	- We doubt if we can do what he requires.- don't listen to yourself or the devils desires to cause to doubt God's will. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Don't give any excuses for disobeying God. </mark> 
- We doubt God because we don't have all the facts. God loves each one of us individually, has a plan for our lives, he will walk us through that plan, he will provide everything we need. There will be difficulty hardship and pain and loss and all that God will turn for our good. If we recognize the source of it. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">All difficulty hardship and trial does not come from the devil, God allows things in our lives to grow us up to mature us in the areas we are not mature in the areas we are not mature.</mark> 
- When we trust Jesus Christ our savior and then great difficulty comes into our lives. That difficulty God allows to shape up, model us, make us, change us, eliminate stuff in our lives that shouldn't be there.  
  We take it personally saying God doesn't love us, but look at the apostle Paul look at the the major characters in the scripture. Look at all the difficulty they went through.  
  All of which God used to establish his purpose and make men and women of God holy.  
 God's goal is not to please you, God's goal is not to give us what we want, God's goal is to fashion us and liken us to likeness of Christ.
- So when there is doubt, doubt usually leads us in the wrong direction. 
  >[!question]  
  >As best as your life, are living a life in obedience to Christ?  
  >As best as i know my life, am i leaving a life believing, trusting God will guide me every step of the way? God want to, desires to and planned to
  
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The outcome of our life, is the result of whether we follow his will or not. </mark>

**Feelings of unworthiness**  
As Gideon and Moses. 
- How many of God's servants stepped out of God's will of their life because they told God they could speak, or sing or do what they were told. 
- Do not under-estimate what he thinks you can do. Because he will help you get it done. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Do not make decisions based on what you think, make decisions based on what God has called you to do. He is going to do what he knows is best for us. Provide everything we need to accomplish, his will and purpose for our lives. </mark>
>[!highlight]  
>Many people back slide, me included. They get back or slip back into sin. Its not so much a slip rather than a decision to do what you used to do what God delivered you from. Because you don't think you can be person God wants you to be. 

- There is not where in the bible that says if one of God's children sins that is it. He says if we confess, he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. God will not make us an outcast because we sin or fall along the way. 
- We make mistakes at time, we choose to disobey God. We pay for the consequences. We should ask God to forgive us we should not walk away, look to him to give us wisdom, guidance, direction and a warning in our heart to avoid that sin. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">God is on our side to enable us to become the person God wants us to be.</mark> 
>[!question]  
>What if you have sinned so badly?

You can't sin so bad God won't retrieve you, but you can sin so bad. You wish you hadn't. Because God has a chastise hand. He loving you back to his will. He will not cast you out because you fall somewhere along the way. 

**Busyness**
- Busy you don't have time to go to church. Busy you don't have time to read the bible. Busy you whisper instead of pray right before you go to sleep. 
- Busyness is a tool of the devil. 
- We live in a world that is in opposition to who we are. We can make it if we rely upon the Lord.

>The Christian life is not easy but it has an awesome eternal end. God will take us home to heaven and he will bless us for all eternity. For our faithfulness, our loyalty, our devotion. 

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">It takes time to be Godly person. It takes time to walk with the Lord. It takes time to know his will. But its is a rocky road. If you are looking for it to get easy. It doesn't get easy.</mark> Some things will be easier than others. But we are not alone. The Holy spirit is in us to enable us. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">But living a Godly life will never be easy and you can just relax. And the next thing you know you are being disobedient to God.</mark> 
- When look at your life and ask yourself, what you are missing. Are you missing that precious time he desires to spend with you? To give you comfort strength, wisdom, guidance, direction, support, help and warnings in your life. 

>[!question]  
>Are you satisfied with your Christian life?  
>Do you feel like you are growing? 

# [Fears in the Christian life](#)
1. Fear of what God may require of them.  
	Our loving father will only require what he knows you are capable of doing, with his help, with his strength and his wisdom. He will never require more than he is willing to enable you to do. 

2. Fear of failure  
	None of us can live the christian lives ourselves. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We all fail at time, we ask God to forgive us and move on. We don't take for granted and do it foolishly. </mark>  
	The road to the will of God is a difficult road, and we will stumble unless we lean heavily upon our Lord. Listen to him and depend upon the Holy Spirit. God's in dwelling spirit enabling you to do anything God requires of you. God's godly assurance.

 3. Fear of criticism  
	_How many times have you disobeyed God because you were afraid of what someone might say to you about your life._  
	It is a shame how Christians can be afraid of other people's criticisms.  
	If you live a Godly life you will be criticized.  
	If you live a Godly life, obey God and attempt to walk in his way and his will, you are going to be blessed no matter what. God is on your side living within you.

# Question
>[!question] Are you walking in God's will for your life? as best as you know your life. 
>

There will be times in your life where it will be easier to be obedient than other times.  
There will be other times where it will be difficult to obedient because of circumstances in your life that maybe you didn't create and someone else did. 

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The safest place to be is at the center of the will of God</mark>Nobody else can put you there but you.   

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">How do you get there? How do you get to the center of the will of God. </mark>  
You ask God to forgive you of your sin, ask him to govern your life, to show you the way, and God with your strength and the power of the holy spirit i will do my best to follow you.  
You can never promise you will never sin again.  
You cannot promise imperfection.  
You can't promise you i will always do right.  
But you can say Lord here is my life, here is my heart's desire and i will trust the holy spirit that you placed within me and promise the power and strength to be obedient to you. ^ffcf96
