<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Sitting for more than 8 hours per day is linked to a 17 to 50% higher chance of cardiovascular disease and death. </mark>  
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Research shows that sitting at a desk all day has similar health risks to smoking and obesity.</mark> But how do you stay active and still get work done?

Office exercises and active workstations are the secrets to improving your mental and physical health without harming your productivity.  
In fact, these stretches and mini-workouts can boost your focus, concentration<sup id="footnote-sup-3"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-3">3</a></sup>, and work output<sup id="footnote-sup-4"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-4">4</a></sup>. Here are 40 quick ways to get moving without leaving your desk!

## Why Prolonged Sitting is Killing Your Productivity and Health

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Sitting has been called a “silent killer” of both mental and physical health.</mark> From our robust cavemen ancestors to the modern worker spending 8+ hours on an office computer, it’s no secret that our bodies weren’t meant to sit at a desk all day. 

There is scary evidence that a sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of death by any cause. Moreover, studies show that sitting just makes you a less effective worker:

- Researchers have found that long sitting times are associated<sup id="footnote-sup-7"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-7">7</a></sup> with exhaustion, decreased job satisfaction, and a range of musculoskeletal problems.
- Poor posture from excessive sitting reduces cognitive function<sup id="footnote-sup-8"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-8">8</a></sup>.
- Prolonged sitting makes workers<sup id="footnote-sup-9"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-9">9</a></sup> more fatigued, reducing the quality and quantity of work.
- Prolonged sitting poses the most risks for highly educated workers<sup id="footnote-sup-10"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-2">2</a></sup> who use the internet regularly.

Whether you are an employee, manager, or business owner, reducing the time spent sitting is in everyone’s best interest. Sitting and standing desk exercises could be the answer.

## What Are Office Exercises?

Office exercises are quick stretches and mini-workouts that you can perform at or near an office or home desk. The human body was not designed to sit at a desk all day, but chair and desk exercises can help counteract the negative health impacts of a sedentary job.

Office exercises are designed to improve your focus, productivity, posture, and physical strength without requiring the equipment or time of a gym workout.

You don’t need to break a sweat to enjoy a wealth of benefits from office stretches and exercises. Research shows that these simple movements can help:

- **Reduce lower back pain**:  People who maintain a static, continuous sitting posture are more likely to have chronic low back pain<sup id="footnote-sup-11"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-10">10</a></sup>. But research confirms that office exercises reduce low back pain<sup id="footnote-sup-12"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-11">11</a></sup> in office workers. Prevent and eliminate low back tension with twisting stretches and standing movements.
- **Reduce neck pain**: “Tech neck” disrupts the natural curve of your spine and adds up to 50 extra pounds of strain<sup id="footnote-sup-13"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-12">12</a></sup> on your spine! Stretching the neck and strengthening your neck muscles can dramatically reduce neck and upper back pain.
- **Improve your posture**: Correct your hunchback posture with seated desk stretches that lengthen your spine and open your chest. 
- **Strengthen your core**: Strong abdominal muscles prevent back pain and create more stability for your spine.
- **Reduced stress and better focus**: Workers who practiced a simple 10-minute yoga exercise reported<sup id="footnote-sup-14"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-13">13</a></sup> better mood and more productivity.
- **Fight burnout**: Studies show that office exercise programs can reduce symptoms of workplace burnout<sup id="footnote-sup-15"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-14">14</a></sup>. If you’re feeling exhausted and unmotivated, desk workouts could be part of the solution.

## 40 Office Exercises

No matter your age, physical fitness, or job type, incorporating some of these exercises into your daily routine could drastically improve your health and productivity.

### Sitting Office Stretches

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If your neck or back is killing you during the workday</mark>, try these simple chair exercises to elongate your muscles, breathe out the stress, and prevent future posture issues. 

1. **Arm reach**: This simple but effective exercise awakens your arms and shoulders while stretching out your ribcage. Reach your arms up by your ears and wiggle your fingers as you elongate toward the ceiling. Feel your rib cage pull upward as your spine lengthens. Optionally, relax your neck and back.

1. **Chair twist**: Sit up straight, engage your core, and slowly twist to one side. Keep your spine as straight as possible. Use the chair or back of your seat as leverage to adjust the intensity of the twist. 

![A woman is sitting in her office doing a chair twist as an office exercise](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/unnamed-16-1.jpg)

Source: [Readers.com](https://www.readers.com/blog/9-desk-stretches-for-office/)

1. **Seated Cat/Cow**: In yoga, cat/cow is a simple posture that alternates your spine in an upward cure (cat) and downward arch (cow) while on your hands and knees. If you don’t want to get down on the floor in the middle of the workday (we understand), you can mimic the posture in your seat. 

Start sitting tall with your hands on your knees. On an inhale, lift your gaze upward, arch your neck back, and expand your chest forward. On an exhale, round your head forward and suck in your stomach. Alternate 5-10 times between the postures.

1. **Seated hip flexor stretch (Chair Pigeon)**: The hips can easily become tight and fatigued after sitting too long. This cross-legged position externally rotates your hip flexor and glute to radiate relief throughout the lower back. 

Sit up straight with your knees bent at a 90° angle and feet flat on the floor. Cross one leg over the other, so the ankle sits atop the opposite knee. Gently begin to press the outer knee of the crossed leg and hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat on the other side.

1. **Seated Crescent Moon Pose**: Add some yoga Zen to your office stretch routine by opening up the side body. Bring your hands straight overhead and touch your palms together. Inhale and reach up, then exhale and arch to one side. Feel your ribs expand away from your hips. Hold for 5 to 10 deep breaths and repeat on the other side.

### Office Chair Exercises

If you have a chair, you have no excuse! These office chair exercises offer the perfect 5-minute break between tasks.

1. **Office balance ball**: Swap your chair out for a [balance ball chair](https://www.amazon.com/Gaiam-Classic-Balance-Ball-Chair/dp/B0007VB4NE?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1) and feel the spinal difference! Balance balls are scientifically proven<sup id="footnote-sup-16"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/office-exercises/#footnote-15">15</a></sup> to improve low-back flexibility, and core strength challenges your balance and encourages good posture while you work.

Source: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gaiam-Classic-Balance-Ball-Chair/dp/B0007VB4NE?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1)

1. **Leg lifts**: Challenge your quads and lower abdominal strength with leg lifts while you type. First, check that you are far enough from a wall or desk that you won’t kick anything. Then, sit back in your chair, press your tailbone down, and lightly engage your core. Then, flex all of the muscles in your legs as you slowly lift your feet from the floor until your legs are parallel in front of you. Hold for 5 seconds, then lower and repeat for 10 reps.

1. **Tricep chair dips**: If you have a stable lockable, or non-rolling office chair without arms, you can use it as a foundation for a quick upper-body exercise. 

Sit on the edge of the chair and place your hands on each side to grip the edges of the seat. Position your feet hip-width apart and move your legs away from the chair as you move forward slightly. Lower yourself down until your elbows reach about 45 to a 90-degree angle, then push back up. You will feel the tricep muscles on the back of your upper arms working. Take care not to lock out your elbows. Repeat for 10-20 reps if you can.

1. **Chair squats**: Imagine sitting down with no chair beneath you. Most office workers are already primed for perfect squatting alignment. Simply stand up in front of your chair, widen your legs to a hip-width distance, and begin squatting down until your tailbone touches the chair. Lift back up and repeat for 10-20 reps or until you feel a nice muscle burn in your legs.

1. **Resistance band glute push**: Get the perfect office booty with one simple knee movement. Place a [glute resistance band](https://www.amazon.com/Renoj-Booty-Exercise-Resistance-Levels%E3%80%91/dp/B087R2Q4HM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=PC5MLEW7BFGP&keywords=booty+resistance+bands&qid=1677017740&sprefix=booty+resistance+ba%2Caps%2C365&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A1QE35XFXR3Y5E&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFCNVVaWVMzOURJWEkmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2MjIyMTUzUlVVS01NWExUV1Q4JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxODIxODdVRzhXU0NLN0haV0Mmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) around your legs just above or below the knees. Sit up straight in your chair, grip the edges of the chair, and bring your feet hip-width apart. Begin to move your knees apart and then back together. You should feel activation through your outer glutes. Repeat for 20-50 reps.

1. **Water bottle bicep curls**: You probably don’t have any weights sitting around your office, but do you have a full water bottle? Perhaps a stapler or purse? Grasp any small weighted item in your hand and sit up straight in your chair. Keep your elbow tucked into your body as you extend your arm toward the floor and then curl the weight back up to your shoulder. Raise and lower 10-20 times on each arm.

1. **Arm circles**: Strengthen your shoulders and warm up your arms with these quick arm-circle motions. Sit up straight and extend your arms out to the side so that your fingertips are in line with your shoulders. Imagine drawing circles in the air with your hands for 30 seconds, then reverse the direction. Experiment with different-sized circles and speeds.

1. **Office chair split squats**: Bulgarian split squats are one of the best ways to build leg strength and muscles. As long as you have a stable office chair (or lockable wheels), this exercise can be performed almost anywhere.

Stand one to two feet in front of your chair with your feet hip-width apart. Lift the back leg and place the top of your foot on the chair so that your ankle is supported. Slowly lower your knee back and down until your front leg reaches about a 90° angle. Keep your torso upright and core engaged. Push back up to standing. Repeat for 10 reps and then do the other side.
