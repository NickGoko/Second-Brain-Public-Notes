## Highlights

> The advent of modern creativity means that everyone, not just those few inspired by the Muses, is invited to transform and shape the world. Each day, people connect ideas together, solve problems, and invent novel solutions. However, the explosion in individual innovation has also led to the proliferation of structured creativity — neatly compartmentalized pockets of creative exploration designed to achieve specific goals in a specific context.

> ## The flow of creativity
> 
> The definition of [creativity](https://nesslabs.com/topic/creativity) has greatly evolved throughout the centuries and across the continents. In the Western world, creativity was for a very long time considered the realm of divinities. Whether they received their inspiration from the Muses in Ancient Greece or the “Creator” in Christianity, humans were considered incapable of creating — limited to imitating or following the rules set by a higher entity.

> During that time, researchers Weihua Niu and Robert Sternberg [explain](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0091265) that “creativity is also viewed as a property that belongs not only to a select few; everybody can exercise it. And its exercise can occur within the mundane experiences of life, not just in the formulation of significant scientific, artistic, or other achievements.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/creative-aliveness-turning-life-into-a-creative-adventure-18dfeb19fc8#9a390990-ff2c-4985-9554-09b1bda51d46)  ^9a390990

> The biggest creative canvas is our own life. The possibilities are practically infinite, the tools at our disposal are many, and each person we connect with opens the door to a potential creative collaboration. However, life can get so busy we end up squeezing our creativity into a tiny canvas — small, pre-defined spaces such as an art class or a brainstorming session.
> 
> Instead of constraining our creativity to these bounded containers, creative aliveness elevates our day-to-day experiences by considering each moment as an opportunity for curiosity and innovation.
> 
> Whether it’s the way you approach a conversation with a person you just met, changing your itinerary to go to work, or composing a little poem in your head while in the shower — creativity can happen anywhere, at any time if you direct your mind to it.
