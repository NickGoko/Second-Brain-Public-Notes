## Highlights

> In French, “cultiver son jardin intérieur” means to _tend to your internal garden_—to take care of your mind. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/you-and-your-mind-garden-ness-labs-18dfe8f908b#9af3b6ad-67e6-439d-b650-afdb322ac0b7)  ^9af3b6ad

> The garden metaphor is particularly apt: taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/you-and-your-mind-garden-ness-labs-18dfe8f908b#24f4f07a-c533-451e-b9b6-e0a370651e7e)  ^24f4f07a

> On the surface, it’s a repetitive process. You need consistency and patience. But each day tending to your “mind garden” is different: discovering a new learning strategy, having a eureka moment, connecting the dots between two authors, getting involved in a lively conversation with an expert.

> ## A gardening guide for your mind
> 
> First, you need to seed your mind garden with quality content. The format may impact how close you are to the source. For instance, reading a research paper will probably give you deeper insights into a specific scientific process and the methods behind the team’s findings, whereas reading a book about a broader topic will give you lots of superficial nuggets of information.
> 
> The depth of the content you consume is not a measure of quality. Reading broad content is also a way to plant many seeds, which you may decide to nurture or not in the future. On the other side of the spectrum, some papers published in peer-reviewed publications don’t stand up to scrutiny (fraud [accounts for 60%](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) of retraction of published papers). Having a diverse information diet is more important than striving for an unattainably perfect information diet.
> 
> When consuming content, grow branches on your knowledge tree by [taking notes](https://nesslabs.com/note-taking). Short notes, long notes—it doesn’t matter as much as writing your thoughts in your own words. That’s called the [generation effect](https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect), and it states that you better remember information when you create your own version of it.
> 
> Over time, you will find yourself going back to certain corners of your mind garden more often than others, and that’s alright. That’s you developing your unique perspective and own gardening expertise.
> 
> A mind garden is not a mind backyard. It’s not about dumping notes in there and forgetting about them. To tend to your garden, you need to plant new ideas. The best way to do this is by replanting stems and cuttings from existing ideas you’ve added to your garden—by consistently taking notes, and combining them together, a bit like grafting (Conor White-Sullivan, the founder of Roam, calls this [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/conor-white-sullivan-interview)). Sometimes, two seemingly remote or even incompatible ideas will give birth to a new insight. (look at the pomato, a weird hybrid of tomato and potato)
> 
> When you find some of these new combinations particularly interesting, share the seeds with fellow gardeners. Leverage the knowledge of other mind explorers. Keeping a digital garden where you can have a shareable copy of your ideas is a great way to contribute to the growth of our collective intelligence.
