## Highlights

> Arm wrestling is often used as a trial of strength, which is meant to ‘prove’ how strong you are. However, while physical strength does matter, most people have no idea how to utilize it effectively, especially in this context. This means that by making a few simple modifications to your technique, you should easily be able to win at arm wrestling, even when fighting against a stronger opponent.

> 
> Most people [mistakenly believe](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/magazine/how-to-arm-wrestle.html) that arm wrestling is just about applying side pressure to the other person’s arm, and trying to push it downward. In reality however, proper arm-wrestling technique involves a significant pulling motion, which isolates your opponent’s arm, and places it in a position where you can easily pin it.
> 
> Essentially, what you are trying to do is make a strong pulling motion, **using your back and shoulders in addition to your arm,** in order to get your opponent’s arm close to you and away from their body. Then, rotate your shoulder and body in the direction that you want your opponent’s arm to go, and apply downward pressure in order to finish them.
