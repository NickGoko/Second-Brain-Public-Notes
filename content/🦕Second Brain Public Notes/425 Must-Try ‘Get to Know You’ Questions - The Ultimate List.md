Meeting new people can be intimidating, especially when you’re not sure how to jump-start the conversation in an engaging way to get to know each other. We got your back!

In this article, we’ll explore what makes a good getting-to-know-you question, a few tips to have a more engaging conversation, and 425 question ideas to get your conversations going!

## What Are Good Getting-to-Know-You Questions?

Good getting-to-know-you questions prompt people to [open up](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/conversation-starters-open-up/) and share more about themselves in a fun, engaging, and non-awkward way. They are usually open-ended and crafted in such a way that can boost someone’s confidence and desire to connect with you.

Putting extra thought into your getting-to-know-you questions helps make people feel at ease and breaks the ice as you build a connection with someone. 

Here are the elements of a good getting-to-know-you question:

- All about the person you’re getting to know (not about what they think of you!)
- Take into consideration a little bit of what you might already know about them 
- Not sideways attempts to collect gossip about others they might know
- Help someone share their likes, dislikes, ideas, and opinions
- Help you both discover things you might have in common 

**Warning:** Not all getting-to-know-you questions are alike. Just because a question gets people to open up doesn’t necessarily mean the timing is right. For example, if you’re just starting to get to know someone, you might steer away from deeply personal questions about past traumas or questions about their views on the current political climate. Deeply personal questions like these are best reserved for later in the relationship-building process.
