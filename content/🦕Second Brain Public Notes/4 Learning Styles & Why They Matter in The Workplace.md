> Knowing _how_ to learn is a superpower. Learning allows you to grow faster, pick up more skills, and invite more advanced knowledge into your life. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/4-learning-styles-why-they-matter-in-the-workplace-18c7f3dd983#2c19f34d-5897-4c37-8df3-839d8e0169e2) ^2c19f34d

> ## What Are Learning Styles?
> 
> Learning styles refer to the various ways in which individuals process and internalize information. Different people prefer different ways of learning. In the same way that people have different [types of intelligence](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/whats-intelligence-type/), this theory assumes that people have different learning styles.

> Here’s a breakdown of each of these learning styles. 
> 
> ### Visual (V)
> 
> Visual learners prefer to _see_ information. The best grasp new concepts through diagrams, charts, graphs, or other visual aids.
> 
> Visual learners benefit most from a flowchart that visually maps out the stages of a project, helping them understand the sequence and relationship between different steps. YouTube tutorials are a goldmine for visual learners.
> 
> ### Auditory (A)
> 
> Auditory learners, also referred to as aural learners, prefer to _hear_ information. They may find it easier to understand spoken words, lectures, discussions, or any format that involves listening, often with back-and-forth dialogue.

> ### Read/write (R)
> 
> Read/write learners thrive on textual information. They prefer reading and writing to understand and communicate ideas. Books, articles, reports, and manuals are their preferred learning modes.
> 
> A read/write learner might learn about a new software system by reading the user manual or online articles rather than watching a video tutorial. Many traditional school approaches rely heavily on textbooks, which isn’t everyone’s ideal approach.
> 
> ### Kinesthetic (K)
> 
> Kinesthetic learners prefer a hands-on approach. They understand new concepts best through experience, practice, and physical engagement with the material.
> 
> A kinesthetic learner might best understand how to assemble furniture by physically manipulating the parts and following step-by-step instructions rather than just watching a video or reading a guide. These folks will jump in the pool and learn how to swim. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/4-learning-styles-why-they-matter-in-the-workplace-18c7f3dd983#cc4f91d4-ec22-4e10-96ba-1e779d3eca5e) ^cc4f91d4
