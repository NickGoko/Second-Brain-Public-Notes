## Highlights

> Interstitial journaling is a productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine. To my knowledge, it’s the simplest way to combine note-taking, tasks, and time tracking in one unique workflow. You don’t need any special software, but [Roam Research](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research) makes it even easier to do thanks to the flexibility of daily notes. Interstitial journaling has had an amazing impact on my productivity and creativity, and I think many people would enjoy it.

> The basic idea of interstitial journaling is to write a few lines every time you take a break, and to track the exact time you are taking these notes. For instance:
> 
> **10:04** - Going to finish the first draft of the mindful productivity article.  
> **10:46** - I fell into a Twitter blackhole again! Back to work.  
> **11:45** - Made good progress. Need to get ready for meeting with Charlie.  
> **11:49** - Reviewed agenda and docs. Feeling a bit anxious, but I think it will go fine. Need to call Anna after the meeting to debrief.
> 
> Notice the mix of goals (“finish the first draft”), self-awareness (“fell into a Twitter blackhole”, “feeling anxious”), self-review (“good progress”), and actionable items (“call Anna”)?

> I love interstitial journaling because it’s a great way to make your breaks more mindful.
> 
> * **Proactive breaks:** reflect on your previous task, plan for the next one, take your own mental pulse, jot down anything else that comes to mind so as to reduce your cognitive load.
> * **Procrastination breaks:** become aware of these breaks and how long they actually take. When you create the habit of writing down all your breaks, it becomes easier to not open a new tab to “quickly” check Twitter. You don’t want to have to admit that failure to yourself.
> 
> Your interstitial journal is not only a journal, it’s a to-do list, a note-taking system, and a way to track your time meaningfully. As I mentioned, you can keep an interstitial journal anywhere. Even a text file would work well. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/interstitial-journaling-combining-notes-to-do-time-tracking-ness-18e031cc758#56236b66-f3ef-4465-8798-25ce79cf14e8) ^56236b66

> This is what a daily note with interstitial journaling looks like.

> 
> * **Track time.** Type _/time_ to insert the current time, then type whatever you are thinking about.
> * **Track tasks.** Type _/todo_ to create to-do items. Check off these to-do items when done.
> * **Track content.** When you stumble upon something interesting that would disturb your workflow, add it to master lists such as \[\[To read\]\]. You can see I have done it in this screenshot with an interesting-looking article that had nothing to do with the essay I was trying to write.
> * **Track ideas.** Similarly, if you think of something else you’d like to do today, just add it as a to-do where and when you think about it. For people using the \[\[Today\]\], \[\[Tomorrow\]\], \[\[Someday\]\] system, you can also add that to the to-do items, or add a specific date, as I have done with “call Morgane.”
> * **Track well-being.** I like to start my work day with a quick note checking in on how I feel, anything that’s been sometimes literally keeping me up at night, any major roadblock I’m anticipating for the day. It’s rarely longer than one bullet point, but it’s a great way to take care of my general well-being. I also finish the work day with a similar quick closing note.
> 
> I genuinely feel silly writing out these instructions. It’s an incredibly simple system to make your journal more actionable—or to actually start a journaling practice. As always, it may not be for everyone, but it’s done wonders for me. I still use [Plus Minus Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) journaling for my weekly review, and interstitial journaling makes it even easier to go back to see what went well and what didn’t during your week.
