Did you know? When you ask someone questions about themselves, it makes you more likable<sup id="footnote-sup-1"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/open-ended-questions/#footnote-1">1</a></sup>!

But research shows, the _way_ you ask a question<sup id="footnote-sup-2"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/open-ended-questions/#footnote-2">2</a></sup> makes a big difference, too. 

Some of the best conversations start with open-ended questions that lead people to open up and form deeper connections.

In this article, we’ll look at open-ended questions, their benefits, and various scenarios where you can use them to boost your conversation skills (and likeability!).

## What Are Open-Ended Questions?

Open-ended questions are questions that are designed to encourage people to share more than a one-word response and typically start with words like “what,” “how,” or “why.” Open-ended questions help people expound on an idea or issue and carry the conversation forward without getting stunted in potentially awkward silence or little to no information for someone else to bounce off of.

Some of the best places to use open-ended questions include:

- Social gatherings
- Dates
- Networking events
- Job interviews
- Feedback meetings
- Sales calls
- Brainstorming sessions
- Qualitative survey data research
- Counseling and therapy sessions
- Conversations with kids (or anyone!)
- Medical appointments

To avoid stunting your conversations, you may want to stay away from closed-ended questions. But what’s the difference? Let’s look at how to avoid those awkward silences.

## What’s The Difference Between Closed-Ended and Open-Ended Questions?

Closed-ended questions lead people to give a one-word response like “yes” or “no,” whereas open-ended questions are great conversation starters or boosters that help bring energy to an interaction.

How you ask or write open-ended vs. closed-ended questions comes down to a few simple adjustments to the words you choose to ask your question. 

To write a more open-ended question, think about where you want to lead the conversation and consider adjusting your opening words.

Open-ended questions often begin with words like this:

- What…
- How…
- Why…
- Tell me about…
- Describe…

Closed-ended questions tend to start with words like this:

- When…
- Are…
- Did/do…
- Can…
- Will…
- Have…

### Open-ended vs. Close-ended Question Examples

Here are some examples of how you might start a conversation and the difference an open-ended, energizing question can make.

Let’s say you’re asking someone about their recent vacation. Which question do you think will lead to a more conversational response?

- **Closed-ended:** _Did you have a good vacation?_
- **Open-ended:** _What was your favorite part of your vacation?_ 

Let’s say you’re interviewing someone for a job. Which question will tell you more about them?

- **Close-ended:** _Are you an organized person?_
- **Open-ended:** _What do you do throughout your day to stay organized?_

Let’s say you’re on a date. Which question will make your date feel like you want to get to know them?

- **Closed-ended:** _Do you get along with your parents?_
- **Open-ended:** _How do you get along with your parents?_

Closed-ended questions may not always lead to “yes” or “no” responses. Sometimes they can lead to short answers as well. For example:

**Closed-ended:** _What’s your favorite color?_

The answer to this question will likely be something short, like “blue.”

One simple way to turn this question into an open-ended question is not necessarily to dismiss the closed-ended question altogether, but to follow it up with an open-ended question as well. For example:

**Open-ended:** _What’s your favorite color and why?_

It should be noted that there is a time and place for closed-ended questions. They are not inherently “bad,” but they generally don’t work as well to keep conversations going. 

Let’s look at some of the benefits of open-ended questions and examples to keep your conversations going in different scenarios!

## What Are the Advantages and Benefits of Open-Ended Questions?

Why are open-ended questions important? Some of the best conversations<sup id="footnote-sup-3"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/open-ended-questions/#footnote-2">2</a></sup> are generated from open-ended questions that lead people to open up and form deeper connections.

Here are some of the other benefits of open-ended questions:

- **Bring energy to a conversation.** By increasing likeability<sup id="footnote-sup-4"><a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/open-ended-questions/#footnote-1">1</a></sup> and simultaneously making others feel more confident, there’s a natural energy induced into the conversation!
- **Reduce awkward silences.** A close-ended question might cut a conversation short, but an open-ended question might keep it moving along. 
- **Boost self-esteem.** As people feel your interest in them with open-ended questions, they may get a confidence boost. Your interest makes them feel more interesting!
- **Provide better feedback.** Instead of a one-sided view, open-ended questions provide a clearer picture from various perspectives about a situation, ultimately allowing people to solve problems better and address issues.
- **Encourage people to open up.** Open-ended questions feel like permission to share feelings and ideas with others who are interested in hearing them.

Now that we understand what open-ended questions are and their benefits, let’s dive into the best scenarios where we can use them with examples for each category.

## Open-Ended Questions FAQs

**Why does an employer typically ask open-ended questions?**

Employers and potential employers ask open-ended questions to give them a better understanding of who you are and what you’re capable of.  
Open-ended questions during the interview process often provide an opportunity for the interviewee to share stories about how they solved problems, overcame obstacles, or succeeded in a specific project. They also provide answers that help employers better determine whether or not to hire someone.  
Open-ended questions are also an excellent way for employers to understand the processes their current employees go through so they can provide better feedback.

**When should you use close-ended questions vs. open-ended questions?**

Close-ended questions should be asked when you need a specific answer. An open-ended question should be asked when you’re interested in qualitative information or a better understanding of someone’s unique experience.  
In a survey, for example, you might want to ask a close-ended question for a data point that needs to be measured, like, “Do you recommend this product?” However, to understand someone’s unique experience, you might ask an open-ended question like, “Why don’t you recommend this product?”
