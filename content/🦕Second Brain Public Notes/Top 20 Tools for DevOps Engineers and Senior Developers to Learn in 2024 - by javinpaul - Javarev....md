> 
> Maven is another popular build tools for Java projects. It brought together two essential concepts, “convention over configuration” and dependency management.

> So, while ANT gives you full control but at the same time rely on you for every information. Maven prefer conventions and provide a lot of default values, which means you need to provide less configuration.

> 
> ## **6\. Gradle**
> 
> Another build tool for Java developers based upon Groovy programming language. Unlike Maven and ANT which uses XML to write build scripts e.g. build.xml and pom.xml, Gradle uses Groovy to create build scripts.
