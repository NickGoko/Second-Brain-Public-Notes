## The STAR Method
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A structured manner of responding to a behavioural-based interview question</mark> by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are describing.
- Situation
- Task
- Action
- Result
### Situation
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish.</mark>  
You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past.  
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand</mark>.  
This situation can be from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.
### Task
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">What goal were you working toward?</mark>
### Action
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU.</mark>  
What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.
### Result
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior.</mark>  
What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.

> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Be as specific as possible at all times, without rambling or including too much information</mark>.

## How to Prepare for a Behavioral Interview?

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Recall recent situations that show favorable behaviors or actions, especially involving course work, work experience, leadership, teamwork, initiative, planning, and customer service.</mark>
- Prepare short descriptions of each situation; <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">be ready to give details if asked.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Be sure each story has a beginning, middle, and an end</mark>, i.e., **be ready to describe the situation, including the task at hand, your action, and the outcome or result.**
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Be sure the outcome or result reflects positively on you</mark> (even if the result itself was not favorable).
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Be honest. Don't embellish or omit any part of the story. The interviewer will find out if your story is built on a weak foundation.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Be specific. Don't generalize about several events</mark>; give a detailed accounting of one event.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Vary your examples; don’t take them all from just one area of your life.</mark>
