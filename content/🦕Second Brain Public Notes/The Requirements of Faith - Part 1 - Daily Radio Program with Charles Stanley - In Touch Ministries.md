	1. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">I must learn to listen to God</mark> - if i can't hear God or identify his voice. How will i know where to go. Where, how long, what, when. When are listening to God, its like he gives us a little bit of light. When we continue to listen to him, he continue to give us more light and more light to light our path. You get more by doing exactly by he says.  
	  <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">How Do i learn to listen to God</mark>  
	  a. **Meditate on the word of God, applying the truth to my heart & life and observing the results**. What is God saying, what am i going to do, what have i done/what happened. - [00:09:43](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Requirements+of+Faith+-+Part+1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intouch.org%2Flisten%2Fpodcast%2Ftoday-on-radio&time=583.797632)  
	  b. **Making a deliberate time to be quiet and listen to God**- - [00:10:13](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Requirements+of+Faith+-+Part+1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intouch.org%2Flisten%2Fpodcast%2Ftoday-on-radio&time=613.591676) Don't just get up and move on after reading the word.  
	  c. **Record make note of what God has spoken to you about**. What you are doing is building an altar. You are noting something God spoke to you about. We must learn to discipline ourselves to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit- [00:11:14](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Requirements+of+Faith+-+Part+1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intouch.org%2Flisten%2Fpodcast%2Ftoday-on-radio&time=674.22051) The Holy Spirit will help you identify what the Lord is telling you. 

	2. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">I must learn to Obey God</mark> - A life of faith is a life of obedience. If you really trust him you will obey him. You only obey those who you trust. Every act of obedience builds your faith.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Genesis 12:10-20</mark> Abraham or Abram at this time did at a time not listen to God and went do to Egypt. He told Sarah to pretend to be his sister so that he don't kill him. They treat him well and gave him animals and slaves. As the story goes God sent plagues to the king and he gave Sarai back. However his actions had last consequence, because he got Hagar as one of the slaves<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Genesis 16:1</mark>. And she would come be the mother of Ishmael the start of the muslim nations. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whenever we don't listen to God and head our own way. It may look real good as it did for Abram because he did leave richer than he went in. It will good for a season but ultimately it won't be that way</mark>When you choose to disobey God or go ahead of him you can't make it right if its not of God. 
	3. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Learn to depend on God</mark> Learn to trust him, rely on him, look up him to meet your needs. He will be what you need. Depend on him to speak to us. Depend on him to give us strength to obey.  

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Part 2</mark>  
		4. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Learn to wait upon God</mark> - God will often be telling you to move and do this and do that. He will often tell you stay still and wait upon the salvation of God. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Be still stop striving and know that he is God</mark>I must learn to wait. "Be of good courage and wait upon the lord"<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Psalms 27</mark>. "God acts on behalf of those who wait for him" <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Isaiah 64</mark>. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Patience = i pause for further instruction</mark>. Wait if not only best for God its best for you. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">If i don't wait i get what i can do. If i wait i get what God can do</mark>- [00:11:12](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Requirements+of+Faith+-+Part+2&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intouch.org%2Flisten%2Fpodcast%2Ftoday-on-radio&time=672.794678)  
		5. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Learn to acknowledge my faith failures to God and learn from them</mark>- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">There comes crucial moments in our lives when we don't obey God. We will spend the rest of our lives regretting it</mark>
