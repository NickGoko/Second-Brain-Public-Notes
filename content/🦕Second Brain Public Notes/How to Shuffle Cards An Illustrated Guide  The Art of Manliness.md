_An important part of manhood has always been about having the competence to be effective in the world — having the breadth of skills, the [savoir-faire](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/develop-savoir-faire-james-bond/), to handle any situation you find yourself in. With that in mind, each Sunday we’ll be republishing one of the illustrated guides from our archives, so you can hone your manly know-how week by week._

I’m surprised by the number of men who don’t know how to shuffle a deck of cards. But you shouldn’t have to hand the deck to your grandpa for shuffling the next time you’re playing one of [the six card games every man should know](https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/games-tricks/6-card-games-every-man-know/). Learn how to thoroughly shuffle a deck of cards just like Gramps, with a bit of flair to boot!
