> Self-Worth: 20 Ideas to Build Self-Esteem | Science of People [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#ed9c9a65-91d3-476c-8882-beae9a0c5424) ^ed9c9a65

> If you have high self-worth, you feel confident and know you are a good person who deserves good things. That’s why investing in your self-worth is one of the best, most productive ways to spend your time today… and I am honored to help. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#30351e55-d5a2-4b64-8b5a-24cfea8aac38) ^30351e55

> ## What is Self-Worth? (_Definition_)
> 
> **Self-worth** is the deep, unshakeable belief someone has that they are loved and worthy to be loved. People with high self-worth tend to have higher respect, confidence, and values. People with low self-worth might suffer from low confidence and feel bad about themselves. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#668ad1d3-b0a8-4e14-8922-557849097772) ^668ad1d3

> Self-esteem is often used interchangeably with self-worth; however, self-esteem can be defined as “feeling” good and confident about oneself.
> 
> The big difference here is that self-esteem is often a fleeting feeling—it can be raised through external factors like receiving nice compliments or buying a new pair of shoes.
> 
> But self-esteem doesn’t last.
> 
> Think of it like this: self-esteem is like a floating cloud in the sky. It can come and go—and it most certainly will—and people with high self-esteem might need constant mood boosters to “feel” good about themselves.
> 
> **But true self-worth is more than that.** It’s the permanent, grounded “knowing” that you have worth. And unlike a cloud, self-worth is more like the earth. It’s an unmovable, grounded belief that is “rooted” in confidence—and a snide remark or unfortunate circumstance won’t completely destroy your self-worth.
> 
> Can you have self-esteem without self-worth? Absolutely. [Narcissists](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-deal-with-narcissists/) are folks who have high self-esteem and put on an air of confidence and self-assuredness. However, they often LACK self-worth because they are compensating for deeper problems within… like a lack of fundamental love for themselves. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#c902a8aa-381d-46e1-84e3-019d622362c8) ^c902a8aa

> Remember… when you feel “good” about yourself over a long period of time, the higher your “baseline” of self-worth will be! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#542834ed-e7d7-485d-9f32-dc1434777c49) ^542834ed

> What Determines Self-Worth? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#f7573bcb-1915-426f-99d7-4918bf225827) ^f7573bcb

> There are 2 reasons why people have low self-worth.
> 
> ### Genetics
> 
> Most people may not know it, but here’s the bad news: self-worth can be inherited.
> 
> It’s been long-known that our genetic makeup affects certain chemicals in our brain, like the amount of serotonin (the happiness molecule) or oxytocin (the cuddle hormone) released.
> 
> Studies even show that [certain genes are linked to optimism and self-esteem](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/gene-linked-optimism-self-esteem). Certain genes can even increase feelings of depression, anxiety, and other negative feelings… all leading to low self-worth.
> 
> But if it’s not genetics, there’s also another reason why you may experience low self-worth or self-esteem…
> 
> ### Trauma
> 
> Low self-worth from a traumatic experience is caused when you mix two ingredients:
> 
> 1. The event: a traumatic experience or situation that causes you to feel bad, and
> 2. The response: a fear response following that event.
> 
> Low self-esteem can happen from being exposed to consecutive, fearful events that span across weeks, months, or even years. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#e18b4e6e-c733-4d00-8ac4-e52ab51c9e96) ^e18b4e6e

> But does that mean we are doomed forever then? Should we call it quits and resign to a mediocre life of low self-worth? _Absolutely not._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#23b5e944-9e3a-439a-81b9-48a03e109dcd) ^23b5e944

> **Here’s the good news: you** **_can_** **fix low self-worth.**
> 
> And the more you reinforce good, optimistic things in your life, the higher your self-worth will be. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#216b211c-9cfd-4ba8-a47e-c57e9fdb94e6) ^216b211c

> ![A cat looks into the mirror and sees a lion. The text reads, "Know your self worth... and don't settle for anything less!"](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/560x315,sFhoEyPbmqjUrfGANuhjziBLeNHWFE9VwIMSqHp3pzPY/https://www.scienceofpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/709154_BlogImage-Self_op1_052120.jpg) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#8612c4ec-1f80-40ab-a85a-8bb3095971a3) ^8612c4ec

> ### #1: Find your anthem
> 
> Go through the music charts and pick a song that makes you feel alive or that makes you feel like the best version of yourself. The best confidence songs make you feel like dancing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#4a066dd4-c63e-4930-84b3-985eca546001) ^4a066dd4

> ### #2: Get up and dance
> 
> Did you just pick your anthem? Great, take a dance break! Not only does [dancing increase your levels of energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318539), but it also has been proven to decrease levels of tension in your body!
> 
> Double whammy.
> 
> And don’t worry about being weird—no one can see you. Here’s an awkward picture of me dancing to make you feel better. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#d17a8a2d-ba72-40c1-a663-5fd40d2bc7b4) ^d17a8a2d

> ### #3: Text 3 Awesome People
> 
> Text 3 people and tell them they are awesome. Do it RIGHT NOW! Sometimes the best way to feel confident is to help others feel confident.
> 
> A [2012 study](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/9197600/Text-messages-boost-happiness.html) conducted by psychologists at the University of California at Berkeley found that lonely or sad people felt much happier when they sent and received text messages. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#f99c37e3-ac48-4ded-9efd-17afcd927289) ^f99c37e3

> There’s no surprise that the team here at Science of People has always believed that [personal relationships](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-make-friends/) are one of life’s greatest treasures.
> 
> So look at your most recent texts or scroll back to texts from one month ago. Ask yourself: who needs to be checked in with? Tell someone you miss them! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#df486a4f-8a07-40ec-96b3-eb9c4956737c) ^df486a4f

> #4: Do the Smile-Nod [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#d9b69dd2-5a2e-4645-abae-aae459e4ecb4) ^d9b69dd2

> It’s that nice nonverbal [facial expression](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/microexpressions/) we do when we want to acknowledge someone. Little do people know, adding that little extra nod takes up _so little energy_… but it means a _whole lot more_ to the person you’re giving it to. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#f7d59c0c-f3f6-4aed-8bae-e80c4881af7f) ^f7d59c0c

> Why is it important? Psychologist [Todd Kashdan](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/importance-of-human-connections%5Fb%5F962540) conducted a fascinating experiment where he walked down the street and interacted with strangers by doing 1 of 3 things:
> 
> * quickly glancing in their direction
> * nodding and smiling at them
> * avoiding all eye contact and pretending they did not exist
> 
> The result is astonishing.
> 
> > When the researcher ignored strangers, not only did they feel disconnected from him, but they also reported feeling a “lower sense of connection to other people.”
> 
> Think about it: When _strangers_ ignore us, we feel more negative and isolated from _everyone_! And the reason is simple: we ALL love to be acknowledged. Being acknowledged makes us feel that human connection we all need. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#541145b1-5567-4fb4-b11b-113d6ef3ddd3) ^541145b1

> ### #5: Favorite Photos
> 
> Think of your favorite photos in your phone or storage. It’s likely they bring back feelings of happiness, novelty, or closeness to others. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#46d4d9fc-85cd-472e-b313-e07825d239e9) ^46d4d9fc

> Now it’s not an “unusual” feeling, since these old photos are more than just taking up precious gigabytes.
> 
> > In [2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235696867%5FLooking%5FBack%5Fat%5FFacebook%5FContent%5Fand%5Fthe%5FPositive%5FImpact%5FUpon%5FWellbeing%5FExploring%5FReminiscing%5Fas%5Fa%5FTool%5Ffor%5FSelf%5FSoothing), a study was conducted by the University of Portsmouth—people who looked back at their old Facebook photos felt an increase in their overall happiness and well-being.
> 
> So we know that positive reminiscing works. It helps you connect with long-lost experiences and friends. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. And most importantly, it reminds you of some of the happier moments in your life. 
> 
> Now go through your phone and pick 5 of your favorite photos that make you happy. Share them, set a new screen saver, put them as your phone homescreen, or better yet, print them and tape them to your bathroom mirror so you can see them every morning. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#88e309c0-22fb-4422-89ab-364d05bda17b) ^88e309c0

> ### #6: Make a Learning “Bucket List”
> 
> Make a learning bucket list! I believe everyone should have a list of all the things they want to learn and try in their lifetime. Every time you learn something, you feel more confident. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#71144834-2725-4ecf-9f22-61bed790f336) ^71144834

> ### #7: Refresh Your Instagram

> Chances are, if you’re like me, you need to spring clean some of those old accounts… and get some people who actually make you feel good! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#ec6cf0f2-20c0-4ca6-b1ee-39fdecc8b03d) ^ec6cf0f2

> ### #8: Stand with Confidence

> Did you know you can stand like a winner? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#ebc3c44d-40c1-46f2-8da2-91ea864d344c) ^ebc3c44d

> > [Amy Cuddy’s research on 55 studies](http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/CzbNAn7Ch6ZZirK9yMGH/full) shows out that power poses affect your emotions, attitudes, and feelings about the self.
> 
> In other words, standing like a winner makes you feel like a winner. So it’s no wonder that winners around the world, no matter their gender or race, typically take up as much space as possible when they win a race.
> 
> The best way to make a winning pose? It’s simple: channel your inner kiddo and pretend you just won the ultimate game of tag! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/self-worth-20-ideas-to-build-self-esteem-science-of-people-18c7d79c4b3#fcecd469-5ee5-4399-b83e-b8586eda4832) ^fcecd469
