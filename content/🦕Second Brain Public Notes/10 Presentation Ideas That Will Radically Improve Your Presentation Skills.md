## Highlights

> ## How to Prepare for a Presentation
> 
> Let’s start with your presentation preparation. Writing, brainstorming, researching, and organizing your presentation is key.
> 
> ### Save the best for last (and first)
> 
> The very first thing you should do when preparing for a presentation is to write down all of your ideas, points, examples, and case studies. I highly recommend using flash cards, but you also can use slides. Put one idea per slide or card. This will make it easy to move your presentation ideas around.
> 
> For example, here are some of the cards I used to organize [my TEDx talk](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ted/):

> 
> Next, you have to put your presentation ideas in the correct order. Many presenters make the mistake of going chronologically, burying their most important points in the middle of a presentation. This is a mistake!
> 
> Most of us remember the first and last parts of a presentation the most. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/10-presentation-ideas-that-will-radically-improve-your-presentat-18c7d43ae25#a603ffc8-fb6b-4da4-a321-7877b6105d9d)  ^a603ffc8

> This is the [serial-position effect](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/773b/234393ef3d95584bc203ed06eeed0077ba9d.pdf)– the tendency of people to remember the first and last items in a series the most clearly.
> 
> > **Presentation Mistake:** Starting off with something too basic, such as background or foundational information, before you get into the heart of your presentation. A slow start means a bad [first impression](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/first-impressions) and a less memorable message overall.
> 
> A strong start and end has marked every important speech throughout history. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/10-presentation-ideas-that-will-radically-improve-your-presentat-18c7d43ae25#338d5dab-6a99-4f50-a6cc-bde889259fb8)  ^338d5dab
