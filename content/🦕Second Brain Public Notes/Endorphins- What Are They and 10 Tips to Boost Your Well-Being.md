[⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/endorphins-what-are-they-and-10-tips-to-boost-your-well-being-18c8288e21b#cbdad7b3-b7ff-4072-a8fc-a6171e9bc010)  ^cbdad7b3

> ### Pain Regulation
> 
> One of the primary functions of endorphins is to alleviate pain [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/endorphins-what-are-they-and-10-tips-to-boost-your-well-being-18c8288e21b#79bcc834-d04d-488c-8f7b-ead70fc06134)  ^79bcc834

> When released, they bind to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, inhibiting the transmission of pain signals and reducing pain perception. This natural pain-relieving effect can relieve acute and chronic pain, contributing to overall well-being. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/endorphins-what-are-they-and-10-tips-to-boost-your-well-being-18c8288e21b#9e16082e-60c5-4050-8c62-cafebb9b0da8)  ^9e16082e

> ### Mood Enhancement
> 
> Endorphins contribute to positive mood regulation and can induce feelings of happiness, euphoria, and relaxation. They promote a sense of contentment and are often associated with the “runner’s high” experienced during intense exercise. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/endorphins-what-are-they-and-10-tips-to-boost-your-well-being-18c8288e21b#2031dd34-261b-4e05-b704-bd6e728dfb15)  ^2031dd34

> However, more recent research[2](#footnote-2)https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-truth-behind-runners-high-and-other-mental-benefits-of-running suggests that a runner’s high is more likely associated with something called [endocannabinoids](https://dictionary.apa.org/endogenous-cannabinoid), which are naturally occurring signaling molecules that affect the nervous [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/endorphins-what-are-they-and-10-tips-to-boost-your-well-being-18c8288e21b#c5466397-a072-4290-9cac-157d8e0ff60a)  ^c5466397

> ### Stress Reduction
> 
> Endorphins help to combat stress[3](#footnote-3)https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/1/338 by mitigating the effects of cortisol, a hormone associated with [stress](https://scienceofpeople.com/stress-management/). They can counteract the physiological and psychological symptoms of stress, reducing anxiety levels and promoting a sense of calmness and relaxation. Releasing endorphins during activities like exercise or pleasurable experiences can help alleviate stress and improve overall well-being.

> ### Emotional Connection
> 
> According to research[4](#footnote-4)https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1700712114, endorphins promote empathy and compassion, enhancing our ability to connect with others emotionally. They facilitate social bonding[5](#footnote-5)https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2021.0176 and create a sense of unity within groups. They also contribute to the experience of pleasure derived from social interactions and reinforce positive social behavior.

> ### Trust and Cooperation
> 
> Studies[6](#footnote-6)https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051117301151 have shown that endorphins can foster trust among individuals who do activities that require cooperation with one another (like singing, playing music, participating in sports, or dancing together). Higher levels of endorphins are associated with an increased willingness to cooperate, share resources, and engage in prosocial behavior.
