The work before the work. That gives you the best chance of success. 
- [00:03:58](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=238.144221) You need to have researched the person have information that will be advantageous to what you you are trying to achieve. 
- [00:04:15](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=255.047356) So what happens prior the work you do before the work is what gives you the advantage.
- [00:05:10](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=310.067955) Think about it like a job interview, how you prepared for all the possible question that may be asked. Considering your strengths and weakness. And how to get around your weak points that may be asked on. You need to bring that kind of tenacity
- [00:05:48](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=348.305715) The difference between manipulation and influence is **integrity**. You have to have integrity. 
- [00:06:38](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=398.831949) Integrity - be what you said you are going to be. You wake up still feeling okay about you were trying to do. Working with the intentions of the other person. 
- [00:09:39](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=579.407441) Two types of influence - one is **look at me** and the other is **come with me**. Everyone with years of success knows the purest form of influence is _come with me influence_. 
- [00:11:20](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=680.090909)Influence with integrity with sustainability in mind. 

# Pillars of Success
## Shortcuts to Success
---
- [00:13:25](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=805.767097) We live in a world where people are attached to bit-sized information or keys to success. And how brains are even wired to seek out these small bit sized shortcuts to success information.  
  We love to ask about that the one thing? What's the shortcut? there is no 'that one thing'. The truth about success is it take a lot of hard work. Which stands in the way of majority of people being able to get it. **Going the long way is worth it**. 
  - [00:14:11](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=851.645011) Stop thinking about the destination. About when you get there or when you achieve that. Once you become influential, once i have confidence.  
    When you want something you need to Ask yourself how much is enough, how much is enough confidence, how much is enough money, you need more time how much is enough time  
    Then the things you start to influence start to change. 
- [00:14:57](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=897.340626) **There is not shortcut to success. Just the repeated execution & mastery of the fundamentals.**
- What you should consider with shortcuts is the tools to reduce friction which is about efficiency. That allows your hard work to run better. 
- [00:16:11](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=971.517314) But all the productivity hacks in the world will not help you unless you have done the hard work, you execute your goals and have mastery of the fundamentals. 

## Confidence

  - [00:16:31](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=991.396735) **Experience is measured in the number of times you have tried something**. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">You cannot have confidence without experience</mark>.  
    <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Confidence without experience is arrogance</mark>. Confidence comes with a level of certainty how something may play out, and you can only have certainty how something may play out if you have been in that scenario a number of times in the past. 
- [00:18:46](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1126.392321) Confidence is a lot about the work before the work. Visualizing or play out all the possible way you can do something before you do something. All the possible way things could go both right and wrong. Drawing from the experience you have had in the past. Work through 1000 micro decision so that when you are the moment you can work through them easier without thinking what you are going to do. 
  - [00:19:21](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1161.805246) So you can serve moment with more confidence because you can be in the moment. The reason people lack confidence is because they are not in the moment. They are somewhere else. Thinking of should(s) or could(s)   
  - [00:19:50](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1190.260798) Inability of enjoying messing stuff up impacts your ability to have confidence. Having messed stuff up adds to your confidence. Staying cool when things go wrong. Everything that could happen has happened before, majority of the time it didn't have in those high stake environment, you had a chance with problem in a lower stakes environment. When stakes get heightened that experience is able to serve you. 
- [00:20:50](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1250.992166)<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Outperforming your experiencepeople try to jump steps of the ladder to quickly.</mark> That where people get vulnerable. When you jump into that situation lacking confidence you need to do more work before the work, you earn your stripes. And you are humble enough knowing what you can't and can. There is a chance you will be able to deliver. When you deliver a number of times you have created a new normal for yourself. 
- [00:21:28](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1288.182166) <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">People are lacking confidence because they are leaving a version of truth they oversold and don't believe inside</mark>.  
  Sales professionals quote "**If you are not convinced you cannot convince**"  
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">If you don't believe you are worthy or worth it, the right person to deliver in that moment then don't expect whoever you is front of you to be able to believe it.</mark> 

## No Right or Wrong when Evaluating My Own Performance
---
- - [00:22:17](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1337.963485)Be okay with things going wrong, you are going to mess up. Be flexible and tolerating when thing don't go perfectly. You are going to mess up at some point.  
  _Limiting belief_ things are right or wrong. It stops the progress of many brilliant people. People live in fear of doing something wrong they are not prepared to try unless they have a level of certainty that can do it to somebody else's judgement of the version of what is right. 
  - [00:23:06](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1386.976743)The alternative of this. Play game in your mind. **Move the finish line**. Don't have finish line of success at the level where everyone else is judging you, push it way passed that.  
    Also have **Short term finish lines** to create multiple finish lines, multiple levels of success in any activity. 

Not about did i win or lose. It about how much did i win by.
- [00:26:17](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1577.565501)How do i judge myself after a moment. People are usually their worst critic.  
  Reframe the language of what did i do right and what did i do wrong? 
> First start - Write a list of your **LBs(what did you like best)**, What did you like best on how that went? keep layering them on

Only after you have written **LBs** do you write your **NTs(Next time)** list, given the opportunity to do this again, what would i do next time? 

**Sub-summary** - Understand the game of Moving the finish line so you have multiple points of winning. Plus approaching every moment with LBs and NTs. Allows you to make a game of your own success story and a continuous quest of self improvement.  
As opposed to did do write did i do wrong. Where its like ice vs water. If you find out what you did wrong its like a moment frozen in time, you can make an ice sculputure but it doesn't help you. But by using LBs and NTs its the fluidity of water that can be taken towards the next thing and feel inspired by it.

**Process Goal vs Outcome Goals**
- [00:29:49](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1789.168617) Process goals don't always lead to success. More than that they help you find out what you need to work on if have enough goals as a reference.  
  Like a basketball court performing an endless amount of reps won't make you an NBA professional but it will tell you what you need to work on and what requires your attention.  
**Being best at something vs Being better at something**  
Most people when asked would say best at something instead of being better.  
- [00:30:11](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1811.373876)**Limiting belief**: being my best at something , trying my best. Giving your best effort is lie. Because we always had more to give. 
  - [00:30:33](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1833.388933)Shift your focus from best towards better. Better beats best over time. When you are looking to be successful in multiple areas of your life.  
    You should ask yourself what am i working on to get better at today?
- [00:30:47](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1847.601655)Those who have achieved optimum levels of success. They dedication to work is focused on better. _Tiny micro-improvements_. 
  - Success leaves clues. And they echo is **control your controllables**. People can be focused on achieving an outcome that totally outside their control. 
  - [00:31:21](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1881.908764)**What is within your control** 
    - The reps are within your control. 
    - The number of attempts. 
    - What you learn from those attempts. 
    - What you do differently as a result of those attempts. 
    - You can control who you learn from. 
    - Who you let speak into your mind. 
    - What you choose to apply yourself on today. 
- **The ability to control your controllable(s) is what allows you to outperform you competition at key moments.**  
- [00:32:08](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1928.138829) Focus on getting the reps in doing the work, executing on the fundamentals, the basics. The things within your control. Things you can do day in and day out. Overtime you improve and get better. Learn and grow. 
- [00:32:24](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1944.729566) Let the focus be internal also. Some people who want heightened levels of success focus on external actions. ''When this happens i will do this''. They are requiring some else to make a change for the change they are looking for to become more real. As opposed to looking for the change that can come from within. 
- [00:33:03](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=1983.594117)**Instead of being a victim of circumstance take as much responsibility as possible.** The outcome will be vastly different than saying it not your responsibility and waiting on someone else to do.  
  _The second you own you get back in control, not all control but more control than you had without owning it._ 
- [00:33:27](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2007.79204) You come learn very few people know what they are doing. Everyone is doing the best they can to make it up. We are all in this dance together. Moves us away from this idea of right and wrong. There is just continuous moving over a period of time.

# Influence Strategies
## Strategies to Diffuse Arguments
- [00:35:05](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2105.692634) People are happy to enter arguments. Trying to prove their version right. As opposed to achieving the right result. 
- [00:35:20](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2120.972143) Start every conversation where your initial point of view is always laced in curiosity. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The person asking questions is the one is in charge of the conversation</mark>. 
  - [00:35:32](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2132.412131) You diffuse an argument with curiosity. Curiosity creates context and clarity. When you are asking questions you cannot make mistakes. You are coloring in the dotted line that you decided is certain way. You may also realize you have the lines in the wrong places. 
  - [00:35:59](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2159.21865) After curiosity you need to insert empathy. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"Empathy is to care about what the people you care about care about"</mark>. You have prove to people you can see the world through their eyes. If they see you can't see the world through their eyes they will continue to enforce the belief that you are not getting, you can't see what they are saying.  
    "Can you hit show me you know me button of influence"  
    Otherwise you are creating unnecessary friction and doubling down on the negative outcome you are trying to avoid. 
- [00:37:15](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2235.711722) When people show up with their argument we are increasing the position of i am right which the person feels right in doing the same. We creates a standstill in trying to change someone's point of view. 
- [00:37:24](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2244.323322) To change someone's point of view you have change their vantage point. To change their vantage point you have to prove to them you have been looking at the world from the same lens. Or you are prepared to move to their side from they look at their world. Curiosity is what gets you their. 
- [00:37:45](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2265.403006)**Content without context is merely noise**. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Before you insert any content you have on an argument. You have to earn the context.</mark>  
  You do that through showing you are curious, then demonstrate empathy by demonstrating seeing the world through their eyes. Then you are courageous enough to ask.  
  **3 step formula** - _Curiosity_, _Empathy_, & _Courage_. In that order always.  
  Because people have the courage to ask big. Like asking for a big business but you didn't have the curiosity and empathy first. Therefore you are seen as pushy. 
  
- [00:38:40](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2320.452593)How do you do a better job at making yourself more curious?  
  The tool for that is to teach yourself a set of prefaces. That allow you to ask questions in conversation for freely as opposed to points of view. 
  
  - [00:39:33](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2373.832676) Courage - if you don't ask you don't get. Courage to ask one more question, the courage to ask for the opportunity you are asking for. Courage to ask is what usually stands in the way of us getting their. Peoples inability to ask is linked to fear. Fear of rejection.  
    Ask yourself what would have happened if you were brave enough to have had asked? If you answer is you don't know. Then ask yourself  
    What could have happen if you were brave enough to ask the question
- [00:41:39](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2499.613251) Rejection therapy^[[[100 Days of Rejection Therapy]]], building the tolerance to discomfort and building that muscle of asking uncomfortable question in the day to day moments of your life. 
- If you want to have uncomfortable conversations go in with the belief you may not be right. Allows you the freedom of someone else potentially changing your mind.
- [00:42:52](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2572.366126) 99 out of 100 you feel better after an uncomfortable or complex conversation. Even if you didn't get the outcome you were looking for but learned more. Don't hold on to things too much. Have the courage to speak up when things don't feel right. Have the courage to be able to enter into conversation with your boss, your parents, your partners. Show to the conversations not with i am right and you are wrong. With i might not be right about this. Help me understand it from your point of view. 
- [00:44:44](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2684.629698) Help me understand plus the humility and willingness to be persuadable to change your mind. And not locked in your beliefs. The world would be a much better place with this framework for interacting. 
- Even if you come away the conversations thinking you knew what you thought you knew. Give yourself a few days to be certain about it. While not in the presence of the other person. 
- [00:45:33](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2733.800432)" Fools and fanatics are always certain, the wise are always uncertain"^[_Bertland Russel Quote_] if you want to be wise you need to be willing to accept you may not always know the answer. 
- Being comfortably uncertain in the majority is what allows you to bring confidence in key moments. Because you are okay however it goes because it doesn't have to go a certain way. - [00:46:32](obsidian://podnotes?episodeName=The+Secret+To+Creating+Influence+In+Any+Situation+with+Phil+M+Jones&url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.art19.com%2Fthe-science-of-success&time=2792.203091)Getting uncomfortable with uncertainty^[[[The Uncertain Mind- How the Brain Handles the Unknown - Ness Labs]]]

> - The worst time to think about something to say is when you are saying it. (_The work before the work_)
