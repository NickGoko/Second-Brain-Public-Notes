> ## The Non-Personal Compliment
> 
> In almost every interaction, I like to start out nice.
> 
> This _usually_ means trying to give someone an authentic compliment.
> 
> But sometimes, you don’t know people well enough to give them a compliment. Other times, you sound kind of fake.
> 
> A non-genuine compliment is not a compliment at all. When you don’t know someone well, the only way you might be able to give a genuine compliment is to use what I call: The non-personal compliment.

> **What is a Non-Personal Compliment?**
> 
> A non-personal compliment is when you compliment something _around_ that person. You can use these if you don’t know someone well enough yet, or you’re trying to [avoid awkwardness](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/socially-awkward/), but you still want to say something positive.
> 
> * “Well, that wine looks great!”
> * “Cool Zoom background.”
> * “That food looks so yummy.”
> * “Cool venue, right?”
> * “I’m so happy I joined; this conversation looks like so much fun.”
> 
> The key to non-personal compliments is to stick to something neutral, but also try to get the person to say something they agree with.
