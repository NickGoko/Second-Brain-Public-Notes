Except as otherwise noted, our prices are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. [Learn more.](https://aws.amazon.com/c-tax-faqs/)

### Why Does My AWS Monthly Bill for CloudWatch Appear Different between July 2017 and Previous Months?

Prior to July 2017, charges for CloudWatch were split under two different sections in your AWS bill and Cost and Usage Reports. For historical reasons, charges for CloudWatch Alarms, CloudWatch Metrics, and CloudWatch API usage were reported under the “Elastic Compute Cloud” (EC2) detail section of your bill, while charges for CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Dashboards are reported under the “CloudWatch” detail section. To help consolidate and simplify your monthly AWS CloudWatch usage and billing, we moved the charges for your CloudWatch Metrics, Alarms, and API usage from the “EC2” section of your bill to the “CloudWatch” section, effectively bringing together all of your CloudWatch monitoring charges under the “CloudWatch” section. Note that this has no impact to your total AWS bill amount. Your bill and Cost and Usage Reports will now simply display charges for CloudWatch under a single section.

Additionally, there is a Billing Metric in CloudWatch named “Estimated Charges” that can be viewed as Total Estimated Charge or broken down By Service. The “Total Estimated Charge” metric will not change. However, the “EstimatedCharges” metric broken down by Service will change for dimension ServiceName equal to “AmazonEC2” and dimension ServiceName equal to “AmazonCloudWatch”. Due to the billing consolidation, you may see that your AmazonEC2 billing metric decrease and AmazonCloudWatch billing metric increase as usage and billing charges get moved out of EC2 and into CloudWatch.

### How is CloudWatch Logs Insights Priced?

Logs Insights is priced per query and charges based on the amount of ingested log data scanned by the query. For additional details about pricing, see [CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) .

### Does CloudWatch Logs Insights charge Me for Cancelled Queries?

Yes, if you cancel a query manually, you are charged for the amount of ingested log data scanned up to the point at which you cancelled the query.

### Does CloudWatch Logs Insights charge Me for Failed Queries?

No, you are not charged for failed queries.

### Cross-account Observability

Open all

### What is Cross-account Observability in CloudWatch?

Cross-account observability in CloudWatch lets you monitor and troubleshoot applications that span across multiple accounts within a Region. Using cross-account observability, you can seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces, without having to worry about account boundaries. You can start with an aggregated cross-account view of your application to visually identify the resources exhibiting errors and dive deep into correlated traces, metrics, and logs to root cause the issue. The seamless cross-account data access and navigation enabled by cross-account monitoring helps you reduce the manual effort required to troubleshoot issues and save valuable time in resolution. Cross-account observability is an addition to CloudWatch’s unified observability capability.

### How Do I Get Started with Cross-account Observability?

Cross-account observability introduces two new account concepts. “Monitoring account” is a central AWS account that can view and interact with observability data generated across other accounts. A “source account” is an individual AWS account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it. Once you identify your monitoring and source accounts, you complete your cross-account monitoring configuration by selecting which telemetry data to share with your monitoring account. Within minutes, you can easily setup central monitoring accounts from which you have a complete view of the health and performance of your applications deployed across many related accounts or an entire AWS organization. With cross-account observability in CloudWatch, you can get a birds-eye view of your cross-application dependencies that can impact service availability, and you can pinpoint issues proactively and troubleshoot with reduced mean time to resolution.

### What CloudWatch Monitoring Features Can I Use across Multiple AWS Accounts?

Using cross-account observability, you can search for log groups stored across multiple accounts from a central view, run cross-account Logs Insights queries, Live Tail analytics, and create Contributor Insights rules across accounts to identify top-N contributors generating log entries. You can use metrics search to visualize metrics from many accounts in a consolidated view, create alarms that evaluate metrics from other accounts to be notified of anomalies and trending issues, and visualize them on centralized dashboards. You can also use this capability to set up a single, cross-account metric stream to include metrics that span multiple AWS accounts in an AWS Region. With cross-account observability, you can also view an interactive map of your cross-account applications using ServiceLens with one-step drill downs to relevant metrics, logs, and traces.

### Can I Still Use CloudWatch Cross-account, cross-Region Features on My Console?

Both cross-account monitoring in CloudWatch and the cross-account, cross-Region features will be available on the CloudWatch console. The cross-account, cross-Region drop-down menus will be removed from the console when you set up cross-account observability in CloudWatch. Note that the cross-account observability experience in CloudWatch is available in one Region at a time. The cross-account, cross-Region feature allows access to organization-wide telemetry through IAM roles. Cross-account observability in CloudWatch uses the Observability Access Manager API to define access policies. Learn more in our documentation.

### Network Monitoring

Close all

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor?

Network Monitor provides visibility into the performance and visibility of the network connecting your AWS-hosted applications to your on-premises destinations. Network Monitor enables you to quickly visualize packet loss and latency of your hybrid network connections, set alerts and thresholds, and then take action to improve your end users’ network experience. If your hybrid network connections are over AWS Direct Connect, Network Monitor allows you to identify the source of any network performance degradation within minutes.

### What 3 Metrics Does Network Monitor Vend?

Network Monitor vends round-trip latency and packet loss for each probe configured in the monitor. Additionally, for hybrid network connections over AWS Direct Connect, Network Monitor vends a metric for the AWS Network Health Indicator. These metrics are aggregated per VPC subnet and per destination endpoint and posted to Amazon CloudWatch. You can then access CloudWatch dashboards from within the Network Monitor console to view these metrics, set up alarms, and view the AWS network health status to see when network issues affected performance. You can also benchmark packet loss and round-trip latency by observing the 30-day history of recorded metrics or set up alarms to be notified of network events.

### How much Does Network Monitor Cost?

Network Monitor pricing has the following components: A fee per monitored resource and charges for the metrics published to CloudWatch. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) and navigate to the Network Monitor tab.

### How Can I Get Started with Network Monitor?

To use Network Monitor, you create a monitor and associate your application’s resources with it. You choose source subnets belonging to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPCs) and then you choose the destination IP addresses in your on-premises network. Network Monitor creates a mesh of the possible source and destination combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor. Network Monitor creation is fully managed by AWS and you should be able to view real-time metrics within minutes of setting up your monitors. Network Monitor vends these real-time metrics to CloudWatch CloudWatch Metrics, so you can easily use CloudWatch tools to better understand network health in AWS regions specific to your network. Please reference CloudWatch [documention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) on detailed set up instructions.

### Digital Experience Monitoring

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)?

Amazon CloudWatch DEM lets you monitor how your end users experience your applications (including performance, availability, and usability). 

Spot intermittent issues, get notified even when there is no user traffic, and monitor your endpoints and UI using CloudWatch Synthetic canaries. Complement synthetic monitoring with CloudWatch RUM to understand end user impact and to get better visibility of your digital experience. With CloudWatch Evidently, improve your end user’s digital experience by experimenting and validating new designs and features. 

### What is Amazon CloudWatch RUM?

Amazon CloudWatch RUM is a real user monitoring feature that gives you visibility into an application’s client-side performance to help you reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR). With CloudWatch RUM, you can collect client-side data on web application performance in real time to identify and debug issues. It complements the CloudWatch Synthetics data to give you more visibility into the end-user’s digital experience. You can visualize anomalies in performance and use the relevant debugging data (such as error messages, stack traces, and user sessions) to fix performance issues (such as JavaScript errors, crashes, and latencies). You can also understand the range of end-user impacts, including number of sessions, geolocations, or browsers. CloudWatch RUM aggregates data on your users' journey through your application, which can help you determine which features to launch and bug fixes to prioritize.

### How Can I Get Started with CloudWatch RUM?

Create an app monitor in CloudWatch RUM and add the lightweight web client in the HTML header of your application. Then start using CloudWatch RUM’s dashboards to receive user insights from different geolocations, devices, platforms, and browsers. 

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Evidently?

Amazon CloudWatch Evidently allows you to conduct experiments and identify unintended consequences of new features before rolling them out for general use, thereby reducing risk related to new feature roll-outs. Evidently allows you to validate new features across the full application stack before release, which makes for a safer release. When launching new features, you can expose them to a smaller user base, monitor key metrics such as page load times or conversions, and then dial up traffic. Evidently also allows developers to try out different designs, collect user data, and release the most effective design in production. It assists you in interpreting and acting on experiment results without the need for advanced statistical knowledge. You can use the insights provided by Evidently’s statistical engine (such as anytime p-value and confidence intervals) to make decisions while an experiment is in progress.

### How Can I Get Started with CloudWatch Evidently?

You can use the CloudWatch RUM JavaScript code snippet to collect client-side user journeys and performance metrics. If desired, you can also add custom metrics like conversions using the Evidently API. Next, new features to be tested can be instrumented with the CloudWatch Evidently SDK, which provides the ability to control how users get exposed to new features. Now you can run launches and experiments, using either the AWS console or CLI. 

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics?

Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics allows you to monitor application endpoints more easily. It runs tests on your endpoints every minute, 24x7, and alerts you as soon as your application endpoints don’t behave as expected. These tests can be customized to check for availability, latency, transactions, broken or dead links, step by step task completions, page load errors, load latencies for UI assets, complex wizard flows, or checkout flows in your applications. You can also use CloudWatch Synthetics to isolate alarming application endpoints and map them back to underlying infrastructure issues to reduce mean time to resolution.

### How Can I Get Started with CloudWatch Synthetics?

It's easy to get started with CloudWatch Synthetics. You can write your first passing canary in minutes. To learn more, visit the [documentation on Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) .

### When Should I Use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently and when Should I Use AWS AppConfig?

The two services can be used separately, but are even better together.

AppConfig is a capability of AWS Systems Manager that you can use to create, manage, and deploy feature flags and other application configuration. When developing new features, you can use AppConfig to deploy a new feature to production, but hide it behind a flag toggle. Once you are ready to launch, you simply update your configuration to release the feature instantly or gradually.

For more advanced feature management and experimentation, you can use Evidently, which is a new capability of Amazon CloudWatch. With Evidently you can run experiments on different feature variations and compare them with a baseline, or launch a feature variation on a schedule, while monitoring business metrics like visit duration and revenue. Evidently also integrates with CloudWatch RUM, which provides client-side application performance monitoring, so RUM metrics can be used directly in Evidently.

### Metrics Analytics

Close all

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Metrics Insights?

CloudWatch Metrics Insights is a high-performance query engine that helps you slice and dice your operational metrics in real time and create aggregations on the fly using standard SQL queries. Metrics Insights helps you understand the status of your application health and performance by giving you the ability to analyze your metrics at scale. It is integrated with CloudWatch Dashboards, so you can save your queries into your health and performance dashboards to proactively monitor and pinpoint issues quickly.

### How Can I Get Started with CloudWatch Metrics Insights?

To get started, just click on the metrics tab on your CloudWatch console, and you will find Metrics Insights as a built-in query engine under Query tab at no additional cost. While Metrics Insights comes with standard SQL language, you can also get started with Metrics Insights by using the visual query builder. To use the query builder, you select your metrics of interest, namespaces and dimensions visually, and the console automatically constructs your SQL queries for you, based on your selections. You can use the query editor to type in your raw SQL queries anytime to dive deep and pinpoint issues to further granular detail. Metrics Insights also comes with a set of out of the box sample queries that can help you start monitoring and investigating your application performance instantly. Metrics Insights is also available programmatically through CloudFormation, the AWS SDK, and CLI.

### AWS Resource and Custom Metrics Monitoring

Close all

### What Can I Measure with Amazon CloudWatch Metrics?

Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. Metrics are provided automatically for a number of AWS products and services, including Amazon EC2 instances, EBS volumes, Elastic Load Balancers, Auto Scaling groups, EMR job flows, RDS DB instances, DynamoDB tables, ElastiCache clusters, RedShift clusters, OpsWorks stacks, Route 53 health checks, SNS topics, SQS queues, SWF workflows, and Storage Gateways. You can also monitor custom metrics generated by your own applications and services.

### What is the Retention Period of All Metrics?

You can publish and store custom metrics down to one-second resolution. Extended retention of metrics was launched on November 1, 2016, and enabled storage of all metrics for customers from the previous 14 days to 15 months. CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution custom metrics.

Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1 minute) are available for 15 days

Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5 minute) are available for 63 days 

Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months)

Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days this data is still available, but is aggregated and is retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. If you need availability of metrics longer than these periods, you can use the GetMetricStatistics API to retrieve the datapoints for offline or different storage.

The feature is currently available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), S. America (São Paulo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Sydney), EU (London), Canada (Central), US East (Ohio), and China (Beijing).

### What is the Minimum Resolution for the Data that Amazon CloudWatch Receives and Aggregates?

The minimum resolution supported by CloudWatch is one-second data points, which is a high-resolution metric, or you can store metrics at one-minute granularity. Sometimes metrics are received by Cloudwatch at varying intervals, such as three-minute or five-minute intervals. If you do not specify that a metric is high resolution, by setting the StorageResolution field in the PutMetricData API request, then by default CloudWatch will aggregate and store the metrics at one-minute resolution.

Depending on the age of data requested, metrics will be available at the resolutions defined in the retention schedules above. For example, if you request for one-minute data for a day from 10 days ago, you will receive the 1440 data points. However, if you request for one-minute data from five months back, the UI will automatically change the granularity to one-hour and the GetMetricStatistics API will not return any output.

### Can I Delete Any Metrics?

CloudWatch does not support metric deletion. Metrics expire based on the retention schedules described above.

### Can I Query Metrics from other Data Sources such as Hybrid and Multicloud Workloads, Amazon RDS and S3, or My Own Custom Data?

Yes, Amazon CloudWatch supports querying data from multiple sources, helping you monitor metrics on AWS, on premises, and other clouds. You can now troubleshoot critical events in minutes, not hours, and gain visibility into your application health, surfacing insights faster for seamless operations. Centralize your querying, visualizing, and alarming across all of your monitoring tools in one place.

### Will I Lose the Metrics Data if I Disable Monitoring for an Amazon EC2 Instance?

No. You can always retrieve metrics data for any Amazon EC2 instance based on the retention schedules described above. However, the CloudWatch console limits the search of metrics to two weeks after a metric is last ingested to ensure that the most up-to-date instances are shown in your namespace.

### How Do I Start Querying Metrics from Multiple Data Sources?

To get started, you navigate to the metrics query builder in the Amazon CloudWatch console and open the data source selector. The selector allows you to start a wizard to add a new data source to query and alarm on. You choose the data source you want to query and specify access details such as a URL or path and credentials. For more details, [see documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloudwatch/multidatasource).

### Can I Access the Metrics Data for a Terminated Amazon EC2 Instance or a Deleted Elastic Load Balancer?

Yes. Amazon CloudWatch stores metrics for terminated Amazon EC2 instances or deleted Elastic Load Balancers for 15 months.

### Why Does the Graphing of the Same time Window Look Different when I view the Metrics in Five-minute and One-minute Periods?

If you view the same time window in a 5 minute period versus a 1 minute period, you may see that data points are displayed in different places on the graph. For the period you specify in your graph, Amazon CloudWatch will find all the available data points and calculates a single, aggregate point to represent the entire period. In the case of a 5 minute period, the single data point is placed at the beginning of the 5 minute time window. In the case of a 1 minute period, the single data point is placed at the 1 minute mark. We recommend using a one minute period for troubleshooting and other activities that require the most precise graphing of time periods.

### What is a Custom Metric?

You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor data produced by your own applications, scripts, and services. A custom metric is any metric you provide to Amazon CloudWatch. For example, you can use custom metrics as a way to monitor the time to load a web page, request error rates, number of processes or threads on your instance, or amount of work performed by your application. You can get started with custom metrics by using the PutMetricData API, our sample monitoring scripts for Windows and Linux, CloudWatch collectd plugin, as well as a number of applications and tools offered by AWS partners.

### What Resolution Can I Get from a Custom Metric?

A custom metric can be one of the following:

Standard resolution, with data having one-minute granularity

High resolution, with data at a granularity of one second

By default, metrics are stored at one-minute resolution in CloudWatch. You can define a metric as high-resolution by setting the StorageResolution parameter to one in the PutMetricData API request. If you do not set the optional StorageResolution parameter, then CloudWatch will default to storing the metrics at one-minute resolution.

When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of one second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of one second, five seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds.

Custom metrics follow the same retention schedule listed above.

### What Metrics Are Available at High Resolution?

Currently, only custom metrics that you publish to CloudWatch are available at high resolution. High-resolution custom metrics are stored in CloudWatch at one-second resolution. High resolution is defined by the StorageResolution parameter in the PutMetricData API request, with a value of one, and is not a required field. If you do not specify a value for the optional StorageResolution field, then CloudWatch will store the custom metric at one-minute resolution by default.

### Are High-resolution Custom Metrics Priced Differently than Regular Custom Metrics?

No, high-resolution custom metrics are priced in the same manner as standard one-minute custom metrics.

### When Would I Use a Custom Metric over Having My Program Emit a Log to CloudWatch Logs?

You can monitor your own data using custom metrics, CloudWatch Logs, or both. You may want to use custom metrics if your data is not already produced in log format, for example operating system processes or performance measurements. Or, you may want to write your own application or script, or one provided by an AWS partner. If you want to store and save individual measurements along with additional detail, you may want to use CloudWatch Logs.

### What Statistics Can I view and Graph in CloudWatch?

You can retrieve, graph, and set alarms on the following statistical values for Amazon CloudWatch metrics: Average, Sum, Minimum, Maximum, and Sample Count. Statistics can be computed for any time periods between 60 seconds and one day. For high-resolution custom metrics, statistics can be computed for time periods between one second and three hours.

### What is CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server?

Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server is a capability that you can use to easily monitor your .NET and SQL Server applications. It helps identify and set up key metrics and logs across your application resources and technology stack, i.e. database, web (IIS) and application servers, OS, load balancers, queues, etc. It constantly monitors these telemetry data to detect and correlate anomalies and errors, to notify you of any problems in your application. To aid in troubleshooting, it creates automatic dashboards to visualize problems it detects which includes correlated metric anomalies and log errors, along with additional insights to point you to their potential root cause.

### What Are the Benefits of Using CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server?

Automatically recognize application metrics and logs: It scans your application resources, provides a list of recommended metrics and logs to monitor, and sets them up automatically, making it easier to set up monitoring for your applications. 

Intelligent problem detection: It uses built-in rules and machine learning algorithms to dynamically monitor and analyze symptoms of a problem across your application stack and detect application problems. It helps you reduce the overhead of dealing with individual metric spikes, or events, or log exceptions, and instead get notified on real problems, along with contextual information these problems.

Faster troubleshooting: It assesses the detected problems to give you insights on them, such as the possible root cause of the detected problem and list of metrics and logs impacted because of the problem. You can provide feedback on generated insights to make the problem detection engine specific to your use case.

### How Do I Get Started with Monitoring Using CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server?

On-board application: Specify the application you want to monitor by choosing the [AWS Resource Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-resource-groups.html) associated with it.

Identify application components: It analyzes your application resources to identify application components (standalone resources, or groups of related resources such as auto scaling groups and load balancer groups). You can also customize components by grouping resources for better insights and easy onboarding.

Enable monitoring: For your application components, you can specify the technology tier i.e. IIS front-end, .NET worker tier, etc. Based on your selection it provides a recommended set of metrics and logs that can be customized based on your needs. Once you save these “monitors”, Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server sets up CloudWatch to collect these on your behalf.

Once onboarded, Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server uses a combination of pre-built rules and machine learning models to start identifying application problems. It creates automated dashboards on CloudWatch with the list of problems detected, and a detailed view for these problems along with related anomalies and errors.

### What is CloudWatch Metric Streams?

CloudWatch Metric Streams is a feature that enables you to continuously stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice with minimal setup and configuration. It is a fully managed solution, and doesn’t require you to write any code or maintain any infrastructure. With a few clicks, you can configure a metric stream to destinations like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). You can also send your metrics to a selection of third-party service providers to keep your operational dashboards up to date.

### Why Should I Use CloudWatch Metric Streams?

Metric Streams provides an alternative way of obtaining metrics data from CloudWatch without the need to poll APIs. You can create a metric stream with just a few clicks, and your metrics data will start to flow to your destination. You can easily direct your metrics to your data lake on AWS such as on Amazon S3, and start analyzing usage or performance with tools such as Amazon Athena. Metrics Streams also makes it easier to send CloudWatch metrics to popular third-party service providers using an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose HTTP endpoint. You can create a continuous, scalable stream including the most up-to-date CloudWatch metrics data to power dashboards, alarms, and other tools that rely on accurate and timely metric data.

### How Can I Create and Manage CloudWatch Metric Streams?

You can create and manage Metric Streams through the CloudWatch Console or programmatically through the CloudWatch API, AWS SDK, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation to provision and configure Metric Streams. You can also use AWS CloudFormation templates provided by third-party service providers to set up Metric Streams delivery to destinations outside AWS. For more information, see the [documentation on CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html) .

### Can I Manage Metrics to Be Included in My CloudWatch Metric Stream?

Yes. It is possible to choose to send all metrics by default, or create filter rules to include and exclude groups of metrics defined by namespace, e.g. AWS/EC2. Metric Streams automatically detects new metrics matching filter rules and includes metric updates in the stream. When resources are terminated, Metric Streams will automatically stop sending updates for the inactive metrics.

### What Formats Does CloudWatch Metric Streams Support?

Metric Streams can output in either OpenTelemetry or JSON format. You can select the output format when creating or managing metric streams.

### Can I Monitor the Cost and Volume of Data Delivered by CloudWatch Metric Streams?

Yes. You can visit the monitoring section of the Metric Streams console page. You will see automatic dashboards for the volume of metric updates over time. These metrics are also available under the AWS/CloudWatch namespace and can be used to create alarms to send notifications in the case of an unusual spike in volume.

### Log Monitoring

Close all

### What Log Monitoring Does Amazon CloudWatch Provide?

CloudWatch Logs lets you monitor and troubleshoot your systems and applications using your existing system, application and custom log files.

With CloudWatch Logs, you can monitor your logs, in near real time, for specific phrases, values or patterns. For example, you could set an alarm on the number of errors that occur in your system logs or view graphs of latency of web requests from your application logs. You can then view the original log data to see the source of the problem. Log data can be stored and accessed for up to as long as you need in highly durable, low-cost storage so you don’t have to worry about filling up hard drives.

### What Are Amazon CloudWatch Vended Logs?

Amazon CloudWatch Vended logs are logs that are natively published by AWS services on behalf of the customer. VPC Flow logs is the first Vended log type that will benefit from this tiered model. However, more AWS Service log types will be added to Vended Log type in the future.

### Is CloudWatch Logs Available in All Regions?

Please refer to [Regional Products and Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for details of CloudWatch Logs service availability by region.

### How much Does CloudWatch Logs Cost?

Please see our [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) for the latest information.

### What Kinds of Things Can I Do with My Logs and Amazon CloudWatch?

CloudWatch Logs is capable of monitoring and storing your logs to help you better understand and operate your systems and applications. When you use CloudWatch Logs with your logs, your existing log data is used for monitoring, so no code change are required. Here are two examples of what you can do with Amazon CloudWatch and your logs:

Real time Application and System Monitoring: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data in near real time. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. Amazon CloudWatch uses your log data for monitoring and consequently it doesn't involve any code changes from you.

Long Term Log Retention: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data for as long as you need in highly durable and cost-effective storage without worrying about hard drives running out of space. The CloudWatch Logs Agent makes it easy to quickly move both rotated and non-rotated log files off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log event data when you need it.

### What Types of Data Can I Send to Amazon CloudWatch Logs from My EC2 Instances Running Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Windows Server?

You can configure the EC2Config service to send a variety of data and log files to CloudWatch including: custom text logs, Event (Application, Custom, Security, System) logs, Event Tracing (ETW) logs, and Performance Counter (PCW) data. Learn more about the EC2Config service [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2config-service.html) .

### How Frequently Does the CloudWatch Logs Agent Send Data?

The CloudWatch Logs Agent will send log data every five seconds by default and is configurable by the user.

### What Log Formats Does CloudWatch Logs Support?

CloudWatch Logs can ingest, aggregate and monitor any text based common log data or JSON-formatted logs.

### What if I Configure the CloudWatch Logs Agent to Send Non-text Log Data?

The CloudWatch Logs Agent will record an error in the event it has been configured to report non text log data. This error is recorded in the /var/logs/awslogs.log.

### How Do I Start Monitoring My Logs with CloudWatch Logs?

You can monitor log events as they are sent to CloudWatch Logs by creating Metric Filters. Metric Filters turn log data into Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for graphing or alarming. Metric Filters can be created in the Console or the CLI. Metric Filters search for and match terms, phrases or values in your log events. When a Metric Filter finds one of the terms, phrases or values in your log events, it counts it in an Amazon CloudWatch Metric that you choose. For example, you can create a Metric Filter to search for and count the occurrence of the word “Error” in your log events. Metric Filters can also extract values from space delimited log events, such as the latency of web requests. You can also use conditional operators and wildcards to create exact matches. The Amazon CloudWatch Console can help you test your patterns before creating Metric Filters.

### What is the Syntax of Metric Filter Patterns?

A Metric Filter pattern can contain search terms or a specification of your common log or JSON event format.

For example, if you want to search for the term Error, the pattern for the metric filter would just be the term Error. Multiple search terms can be included to search for multiple terms. For example, if you wanted to count events which contained the terms Error and Exception you would use the pattern Error Exception. If you wanted to match the term Error Exception exactly, you would put double quotes around the search term, "Error Exception". You can specify as many search terms as you like.

CloudWatch Logs can also be used to extract values from a log event in common log or JSON format. For example, you could track the bytes transferred from your Apache access logs. You can also use conditional operators and wildcards to match and extract the data you are interested in. To use the extraction feature of Metric Filters, log events must be space delimited and use a starting and ending double quote """, or, a starting square brace "\[" and a closing square brace "\]"square, to enclose fields. Alternatively, they can be JSON-formatted log events. For the full details of the syntax and examples, please see the [Developer Guide for Metric Filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) .

### How Do I Know that a Metric Filter Pattern I Specified Will Match My Log Events?

CloudWatch Logs lets you test the Metric Filter patterns you want before you create a Metric Filter. You can test your patterns against your own log data that is already in CloudWatch Logs or you can supply your own log events to test. Testing your pattern will show you which log events matched the Metric Filter pattern and, if extracting values, what the extracted value is in the test data. Metric Filter testing is available for use in the console and the CLI.

### Can I Use Regular Expressions with My Log Data?

Amazon CloudWatch Metric Filters does not support regular expressions. To process your log data with regular expressions, consider using [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) and connect the stream with a regular expression processing engine.

### Log Management

### How Do I Retrieve My Log Data?

You can retrieve any of your log data using the CloudWatch Logs console or through the CloudWatch Logs CLI. Log events are retrieved based on the Log Group, Log Stream and time with which they are associated. The CloudWatch Logs API for retrieving log events is GetLogEvents.

### How Do I search My Logs?

You can use the CLI to retrieve your log events and search through them using command line grep or similar search functions.

### How long Does CloudWatch Logs Store My Log Data?

You can store your log data in CloudWatch Logs for as long as you want. By default, CloudWatch Logs will store your log data indefinitely. You can change the retention for each Log Group at any time.

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs Standard?

Amazon CloudWatch Logs Standard is one of two log classes offered by CloudWatch. Logs Standard delivers comprehensive log management intended for real-time monitoring and advanced analytics capabilities like Live Tail, metric extraction, alarming, and data protection. You can monitor your logs, in near real time, for specific phrases, values or patterns. For example, you could set an alarm on the number of errors that occur in your system logs or view graphs of latency of web requests from your application logs. You can then view the original log data to see the source of the problem.

### What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs Infrequent Access (Logs-IA)?

Amazon CloudWatch Logs Infrequent Access (Logs-IA) is one of two log classes offered by CloudWatch. Logs-IA is purpose-built for consolidating all your logs natively on AWS. It offers the managed ingestion, cross-account log analytics, and encryption of CloudWatch Logs Standard, with a low per GB ingestion price. This combination of tailored capabilities and low cost make CloudWatch Logs-IA ideal for ad-hoc querying and after-the-fact forensic analysis.

### What Permissions Do I Need to Access Logs Insights?

To access Logs Insights, your IAM policy must include permissions for logs:DescribeLogGroups and logs:FilterLogEvents.

### What Logs Can I Query with CloudWatch Logs Insights?

You can use Logs Insights to query all logs being sent to CloudWatch. Logs Insights automatically discovers the logs fields from logs from AWS services such as Lambda, CloudTrail, Route53, and VPC Flow Logs; and any application log that generates log events in JSON format. Additionally, for all log types, it generates 3 system fields @message, @logStream, and @timestamp for all logs sent to CloudWatch. @message contains the raw unparsed log event, @logStream contains the name of the source that generated the log event, and @timestamp contains the time at which the log event was added to CloudWatch.

### Which Query Language Does CloudWatch Logs Insights Support?

Logs Insights introduces a new purpose-built query language for log processing. The query language supports a few simple, but powerful query commands. You can write commands to retrieve one or more log fields, find log events that match one or more search criteria, aggregate your log data, and extract ephemeral fields from your text-based logs. The query language is easy to learn, and Logs Insights offers in-product help in the form of sample queries, command descriptions, and query auto-completion to help you get started. You can find additional details about the query language here.

### What Are the Service Limits for CloudWatch Logs Insights?

### Logs Data Protection

### What is Data Protection in Amazon CloudWatch Logs?

Data protection is a feature in CloudWatch Logs that allows you to define your own rules and policies to automatically detect and mask sensitive data within logs that are collected from your systems and applications. This is done using machine learning (ML) and pattern matching. Data can be viewed unmasked with elevated Identity and Access Management (IAM) privileges.

### Why Should I Use Data Protection in CloudWatch Logs?

To prevent logging sensitive data, customers sometimes rely on manual investigation or by conﬁguring short log retention policies to delete logs, which runs the risk of losing valuable operational logs. CloudWatch Logs data protection automatically identiﬁes and masks sensitive information in your logs using pattern matching and ML without requiring that anybody access them. This feature is useful for industries under strict regulations that need to make sure that no personal information gets stored. Also, customers building payment or authentication services where a lot of personal and sensitive information is required can use this new feature to reduce the probability of unneeded information getting stored in their logs.

### What Kind of Sensitive Data Can I Protect in CloudWatch Logs?

When you create the data protection policy in CloudWatch Logs, you can specify the data you want to protect. There are many data identiﬁers for you to choose from, such as email addresses, driver’s licenses from many countries, credit card numbers, addresses, and more. The variety of targeted data identiﬁers provides the flexibility to choose what sensitive data is used by your applications and mask the sensitive data that does not need to be easily accessible. It is important that you decide what information is sensitive to your application and select the relevant identiﬁers for your use cases.

### Alarms

### What Types of CloudWatch Alarms Can Be Created?

You can create an alarm to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in your account. For example, you can create alarms on an Amazon EC2 instance CPU utilization, Amazon ELB request latency, Amazon DynamoDB table throughput, Amazon SQS queue length, or even the charges on your AWS bill.

You can also create an alarm on custom metrics that are specific to your custom applications or infrastructure. If the custom metric is a high-resolution metric, you have the option of creating high-resolution alarms that alert as soon as 10-second or 30-second periods.

With composite alarms, you can combine multiple alarms into alarm hierarchies. This reduces alarm noise by triggering just once when multiple alarms fire at the same time. You can provide an overall state for a grouping of resources like an application, AWS Region, or Availability Zone.

Please reference the [CloudWatch pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) to learn more.

### What Actions Can I Take from a CloudWatch Alarm?

When you create an alarm, you can configure it to perform one or more automated actions when the metric you chose to monitor exceeds a threshold you define. For example, you can set an alarm that sends you an email, publishes to an SQS queue, stops or terminates an Amazon EC2 instance, or executes an Auto Scaling policy. Since Amazon CloudWatch alarms are integrated with Amazon Simple Notification Service, you can also use any notification type supported by SNS. You can use the AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter action to automatically create an OpsItem when an alarm enters the ALARM state. This helps you to quickly diagnose and remediate issues with AWS resources from a single console.

### What Thresholds Can I Set to Trigger a CloudWatch Alarm?

When you create an alarm, you first choose the Amazon CloudWatch metric you want it to monitor. Next, you choose the evaluation period (e.g., five minutes or one hour) and a statistical value to measure (e.g., Average or Maximum). To set a threshold, set a target value and choose whether the alarm will trigger when the value is greater than (>), greater than or equal to (>=), less than (<), or less than or equal to (<=) that value.

### My CloudWatch Alarm is Constantly in the Alarm State, what Did I Do Wrong?

Alarms continue to evaluate metrics against your chosen threshold, even after they have already triggered. This allows you to view its current up-to-date state at any time. You may notice that one of your alarms stays in the ALARM state for a long time. If your metric value is still in breach of your threshold, the alarm will remain in the ALARM state until it no longer breaches the threshold. This is normal behavior. If you want your alarm to treat this new level as OK, you can adjust the alarm threshold accordingly.

### How long Can I view My Alarm History?

Alarm history is available for 14 days. To view your alarm history, log in to CloudWatch in the AWS Management Console, choose Alarms from the menu at left, select your alarm, and click the History tab in the lower panel. There you will find a history of any state changes to the alarm as well as any modifications to the alarm configuration.

### Dashboards

### What is CloudWatch Dashboards?

Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards allow you to create, customize, interact with, and save graphs of AWS resources and custom metrics.

### How Do I Get Started with CloudWatch Dashboards?

To get started, visit the [Amazon CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) and select “Dashboards”. Click the “Create Dashboard” button. You can also copy the desired view from Automatic Dashboards by clicking on Options -> “Add to Dashboard”.

### What Are the Advantages of Automatic Dashboards?

Automatic Dashboards are pre-built with AWS service recommended best practices, remain resource aware, and dynamically update to reflect the latest state of important performance metrics. You can now filter and troubleshoot to a specific view without adding additional code to reflect the latest state of your AWS resources. Once you have identified the root cause of a performance issue, you can quickly act by going directly to the AWS resource.

### Do the Dashboards Support Auto Refresh?

Yes. Dashboards will auto refresh while you have them open.

### Can I Share My Dashboard?

Yes, a dashboard is available to anyone with the correct permissions for the account with the dashboard.

### Events

### What is CloudWatch Events?

Amazon CloudWatch Events (CWE) is a stream of system events describing changes in your AWS resources. The events stream augments the existing CloudWatch Metrics and Logs streams to provide a more complete picture of the health and state of your applications. You write declarative rules to associate events of interest with automated actions to be taken.

### What Services Emit CloudWatch Events?

Currently, Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and AWS CloudTrail are supported. Via AWS CloudTrail, mutating API calls (i.e., all calls except Describe\*, List\*, and Get\*) across all services are visible in CloudWatch Events.

### What Can I Do once an Event is Received?

When an event matches a rule you've created in the system, you can automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function, relay the event to an Amazon Kinesis stream, notify an Amazon SNS topic, or invoke a built-in workflow.

### Can I Generate My Own Events?

Yes. Your applications can emit custom events by using the PutEvents API, with a payload uniquely suited to your needs.

### Can I Do Things on a Fixed Schedule?

CloudWatch Events is able to generate events on a schedule you set by using the popular Unix cron syntax. By monitoring for these events, you can implement a scheduled application.

### What is the Difference between CloudWatch Events and AWS CloudTrail?

CloudWatch Events is a near real time stream of system events that describe changes to your AWS resources. With CloudWatch Events, you can define rules to monitor for specific events and perform actions in an automated manner. AWS CloudTrail is a service that records API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files containing API calls to your Amazon S3 bucket or a CloudWatch Logs log group. With AWS CloudTrail, you can look up API activity history related to creation, deletion and modification of AWS resources and troubleshoot operational or security issues.

### What is the Difference between CloudWatch Events and AWS Config?

AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance. Config rules help you determine whether configuration changes are compliant. CloudWatch Events is for reacting in near real time to resource state changes. It doesn’t render a verdict on whether the changes comply with policy or give detailed history like Config/Config Rules do. It is a general purpose event stream.
