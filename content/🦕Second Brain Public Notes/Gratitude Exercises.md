Gratitude means appreciating the good things in life, no matter how big or small. Making the practice of
gratitude a regular part of your day can build happiness, self-esteem, and provide other health benefits.

## Gratitude Journal

Every evening, spend a few minutes writing down some good things about your day. This isn’t limited to  
major events. You might be grateful for simple things, such as a good meal, talking to a friend, or  
overcoming an obstacle.

## Give Thanks

Keep your eyes open throughout the day for reasons to say “thank you.” Make a conscious effort to notice  
when people do good things, whether for you or others. Tell the person you recognize their good deed, and  
give a sincere “thank you.”

## Mindfulness Walk

Go for a walk and make a special effort to appreciate your surroundings. You can do this by focusing on  
each of your senses, one at a time. Spend a minute just listening, a minute looking at your surroundings, and  
so on. Try to notice the sights, sounds, smells, and sensations you would usually miss, such as a cool  
breeze on your skin, or the clouds in the sky.

## Gratitude Letter

Think about someone who you appreciate. This could be a person who has had a major impact on your life,  
or someone who you would like to thank. Write a letter that describes why you appreciate them, including  
specific examples and details. It's up to you if you’d like to share the letter or not.

## Grateful Contemplation

Remove yourself from distractions such as phones or TV and spend 5-10 minutes mentally reviewing the  
good things from your day. The key to this technique is _consistency_. Think of it like brushing your teeth or  
exercise—it should be a normal part of daily self-care. This technique can be practiced as part of prayer,  
meditation, or on its own.

## Gratitude Conversation

With another person, take turns listing 3 things you were grateful for throughout the day. Spend a moment  
discussing and contemplating each point, rather than hurrying through the list. Make this part of your  
routine by practicing before a meal, before bed, or at another regular time.
