Arm wrestling is [a classic feat of strength](https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/manly-feats-of-strength/). Matches can break out anywhere and anytime, from the playground at recess to the bar at last call. Many people believe it to be a simple test of strength — used to determine who among two men is stronger. But, as with many sports, the actual secret to beating your opponent is not about being the biggest or even strongest man in the room. It’s about strategy. And, when it comes to arm wrestling, the best strategy is to manipulate the angle of your opponent’s wrist, so you can decrease their leverage power and increase yours. With the right angle, a much scrawnier man can easily beat a much beefier one.

There are two arm wrestling moves every man should know, The Hook and The Top Roll. The key to each technique is to implement them the second the match starts, when your grips are still getting established. Both moves are effective, but one may work better with certain opponents. The Hook is simpler, but not as effective if your opponent is much stronger than you. The Top Roll is more complex, but gives you greater leverage to beat bigger dudes. You may also find that using a combination of the two is the best way to achieve dominance and pull out the victory.
